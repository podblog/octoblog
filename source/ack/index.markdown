No venture can be done alone. You always gotta ask someone for help. It's terribly unhip these days to acknowledge your crew on your own website, but I'm a caveman in terms of the internet (ca. 1992) so I'm gonna do it how I think it should be done, and it was done. Back in the day, you used to give a little shout-out to the people and things who made your slice of life possible.

And in no particular order, so guys, don't fight. Actually, fight, it'd be humorous to watch Ryan Porter and Deepsleep have a rumble. Tai Chi versus Cuban tagger street-fighting. Blogged on Octopress. But anyways.


<a href="http://ryanalynporter.com/">**Ryan Porter**</a> - Web and mobile application developer. He's the one who clued me in to this way of doing things. We've worked together on a few things nightlife-tech related and otherwise.

<a href="http://deepsleepstudio.com/">**Deepsleep**</a> - Alex Martinez, graphic designer of top-notchedness. He did the fancy logo you see up top. He'll do a fancy logo for you too if you ask nicely and pay him. The results are worth it.
