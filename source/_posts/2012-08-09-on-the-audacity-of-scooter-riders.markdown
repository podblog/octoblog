One of my pet peeves since moving here ages ago has been the scooter rider. 

Now, I recognize the utility of the scooter. It's light, efficient, and you can stow it almost
anywhere when not in use. Plus, you don't need insurance, and LEOs tend to leave you be.

It is probably the last one which makes scooter riders so obnoxious...

Before I acquired my current mode of personal transport, I would either take public transit, or on occasion, have 
the use of a friend's scooter. They're fun to ride, and useful for getting around the Beach and the Downtown area. 
However, being that there's nothing between you and the road but your clothes, I tended to ride cautiously, knowing that
I'm not as visible as I would be in a car or truck. It was up to me to watch where I was going. 

However, most scooter riders do not. They ride like they own the road, and expect other motorists to watch out for them. 
Now, realistically, that is fair since they have the lighter and less powerful vehicle. But fair only if they are obeying the 
same rules of the road the rest of us try to do. For the most part, scooter riders around here tend to weave in and out of traffic
with abandon, often in packs. You see the 'pack' phenomenon on Memorial Day Weekend, when herds of tourists rent every available
scooter on the Beach and troll Washington Avenue in packs of twenty or more, as if they were some sort of mentally-challenged
chapter of the Hell's Angels. 

Worse yet, your average scooter rider will blame you for any of their indiscretions on the road. 

Case in point. Yesterday, I was leaving the Publix complex on Fifth and Alton. As I eased on to Lenox Avenue into the flow of traffic, 
a kid, dare I say a *chmak*, on a Vespa was closing in on me rather fast. Now, the light ahead of me was red, so myself and the drivers in front of me clearly could not
move. The scooter rider, rather than stop and join the flow of traffic as he would have been required to do, swerved to the *right* of me and
the rest of the cars in the lane, choosing to wedge his noisy lawn-mower-sounding contraption between all of us and the sidewalk. My outraged
fellow car drivers honked in protest as he wedged through, only to be met by a stream of incoherent curses and curiously random gestures which 
may have passed for obscene in some far-flung nation on the other side of the world. I suppose flailing your arms about and screaming could
be considered an obscene gesture, somewhere. There's a lot of people on this planet. All the while, this kid's conveyance was still in forward 
motion. 

Someone less kind than me could have taken exception to that, actually. This is Miami, after all. The kid on the Vespa is damn lucky in that
regard. 

Scooter riders, scoot all you want, but realize it's a two-way street. You're on a motor vehicle too. It's a scooter, not a Hayabusa.
