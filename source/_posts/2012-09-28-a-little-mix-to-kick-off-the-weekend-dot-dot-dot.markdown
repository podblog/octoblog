Well, I figured out the audio player thing. Just a little work with the includes was all I needed to do to make it all come together... 

<!-- more -->

So, with that, I'm gonna post a mix for you all to enjoy. This one, is done by some friends of mine, the duo <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DJSESSANDEMM">Ess & Emm</a>. Sasha and Michelle mix up some nu-disco and more for your listening enjoyment. Press play, the audio player works! And yes, all things considered, if I was a DJ, I'd play nu-disco. Just the way it is.

They will be providing the soundtrack this evening at Chalk, just in time for the <a href="http://forum.talknightlife.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=20004">TNL 5th Anniversary</a> Unofficial Official Party. Hell, it's technically their party, "Beaver Feaver", we're just imposing on it. Sorry about that, girls. But that's how we roll.
