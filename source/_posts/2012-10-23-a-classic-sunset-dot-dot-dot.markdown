You definitely can't argue with the sunsets on the Outer Banks of North Carolina. 

<!-- more -->

Sure, sunset photos are contrived and "have been done", but sometimes, regardless of your skill level, every photographer needs to shoot a few "typical" images. If anything, for those of us who take ourselves too seriously, you can justify it as a "test" or "calibration" or "comparison". 

Besides, it's rather nice-looking. 

I think in terms of "a place to go to do nothing", Emerald Isle has Key West beat. There is absolutely nothing going on but the weather. No clubs, no bars, just some pretty pricey real estate and people just kicking back. You have to bring your own fun, essentially. Which was kind of nice.
