<p>Since 1999, the bulk of my photographic work has focused on the dance music culture of the major cities of the United States, including the Miami metropolitan area, New York, and Las Vegas. In this decade of time, the “nightlife photographer” has risen from being a marginal player in the scene to an integral, almost ubiquitous documentarian.</p>

<p>With an eye towards getting away from that ubiquity, I utilize all the elements within the events and locations I’ve had the privilege of shooting at. Not content to use just a flash perched on top of my camera, I’ll utilize existing lights, reflections, fog, smoke, and look for the mysterious “right look” as it applies to what I do, in order to get the image.</p>
