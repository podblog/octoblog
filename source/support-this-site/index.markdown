I do what I do because I like to do it, not for any financial reward. You can't take it with you, after all. Even if you could, half the fun is building it up all over again in the next life. Don't take that as an endorsement of reincarnation or anything. But, there is an operational expense in bringing to you my small body of visual works, my occasional diatribes, and frequent random brain droppings. So, if you can, please consider purchasing a printed copy of one of my images, or commissioning me to produce something specifically for your needs. And yes, I'll confess to enjoying a few of the finer things in life too. But we all have our vices.

So, if you are of a mind, you can purchase some of my more thoughtful works, and some of my less thoughtful ones, too. Link action starts now.

Purchase landscapes and scenic prints via my print provider, <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">Fine Art America.</a> Several sizes and finishes are available, and the turnaround time is very reasonable. The pieces featured make a fantastic addition to anyone's home or office. These prints are produced to last a lifetime, so consider it as a worthwhile investment into independent art.

This is more experimental, but my Instagram blurbs are now available in print form. Someone told me my Instagrams have value. Maybe they do. If they do to you, why not buy a print of one? It's fairly cheap for what you get. A little service called Instacanvas plays host to all them. You can find these small works of mine at <a href="http://instacanv.as/pod_gram">instacanv.as/pod_gram</a>.

Of course I'm available to shoot your event, show, tour, venue or property. I'm also available for specific commissions, i.e. if you wish to have a one-of-a-kind image of a specific scene to call your own. Drop me a line at dan at dan-vidal dot com. Partially obfuscated to fool those spam robots. My rates and licensing terms are quite reasonable and can be customized to your needs.
