I do what I do because I like to do it, not for any financial reward. While I enjoy the finer things in life that may cost a dollar or two, there is an operational expense incurred in my activities. What I'm getting at is the bills don't pay themselves, basically. And it's considered bad form to take L-series lenses and not pay for them. I hear they arrest you for that sort of thing. 

And the finer things in life that I enjoy keep me less cranky. And those who know me, know that I'm not such a bad guy when I'm not being cranky. 

So, if you are of a mind, you can purchase some of my more thoughtful works, and some of my less thoughtful ones, too. Link action starts now.


Purchase landscapes and scenic prints via my print provider, <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">Fine Art America.</a> Several sizes and finishes are available, and the turnaround time is very reasonable. The pieces featured make a fantastic addition to anyone's home or office. These prints are produced to last a lifetime, so consider it as a worthwhile investment into independent art.

This is more experimental, but my Instagram blurbs are now available in print form. Someone told me my Instagrams have value. Maybe they do. If they do to you, why not buy a print of one? It's fairly cheap for what you get. A little service called Instacanvas plays host to all them. You can find these small works of mine at <a href="http://instacanv.as/pod_gram">instacanv.as/pod_gram</a>.

Of course I'm available to shoot your event, show, tour, venue or property. I'm also available for specific commissions, i.e. if you wish to have a one-of-a-kind image of a specific scene to call your own. Drop me a line at dan at dan-vidal dot com. Partially obfuscated to fool those spam robots. My rates and licensing terms are quite reasonable and can be customized to your needs.
