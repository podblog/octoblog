  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ferrer-2724.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'I can seeeeee you!'" ></p>

<p>Local photojournalist and all-around good guy <a href="http://www.pixiq.com/contributors/248">Carlos Miller</a> got me thinking recently after the last <a href="http://www.pixiq.com/article/four-cop-cars-get-called-on-us">photo protest</a> he staged in front of the Miami Herald building.</p>

<p>A lot of people have a fear of photography. And I really can&#8217;t figure out why. Sure, for some people I can see it. They&#8217;re doing something they probably shouldn&#8217;t be, and there&#8217;s scads of photographic recording devices around them, which may or may not be recording their actions. I encounter it out in the clubs from time to time. I like to shoot wide, as you can see above, and I may inadvertently capture someone doing something (or someone, ba-dum-ching&#8230;) they shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>It certainly isn&#8217;t deliberate on my part though. Whatever transgressions you may be committing, that&#8217;s your problem and not mine. I&#8217;m not out to ruin your life, since it appears that you&#8217;re quite capable of doing that on your own. And no, I won&#8217;t delete it. You are a noisy red smear at the bottom of the frame. And you probably shouldn&#8217;t be cheating on your pretty wife in front of thousands of people and about that many cameras.</p>

<p>But, that&#8217;s just with crackheads in nightclubs, which, fortunately, form a small minority of our population.</p>

<p>The real head-scratcher is the people who get worked up over photography in public places. If you can see it from a public location, you can shoot it, it&#8217;s that simple. I don&#8217;t buy the national security bit or anything of that nature. If I take a photo of the refinery near Fort Lauderdale airport, the photo, other than a creative piece, tells me nothing. It&#8217;s a collection of pipes. It won&#8217;t aid a terrorist in planning to blow it up. And, if a terrorist wants to blow up the refinery, a photo isn&#8217;t going to hinder or help him or her too much. It&#8217;s not like in the movies where they can deduce where the 2-meter wide exhaust vent is from a cell phone photo.</p>

<p>Even more puzzling are the ordinary citizens who bring it upon themselves to get worked up over photos in public places. The photo protest I mentioned is a perfect example. In a nutshell, the ordinary citizen was a security guard, who took it upon himself to misquote the law, leading to the situation described in Carlos&#8217; blog entry. Now, a few words on that.</p>

<p>A security guard is an ordinary citizen. He doesn&#8217;t have police powers. As a matter of fact, he&#8217;s even more restricted from certain actions in the course of his job than an ordinary citizen is. The industry&#8217;s slogan is &#8220;Observe and Report&#8221;. That&#8217;s about all they can do. Plus, from a pragmatic perspective, the pay scale isn&#8217;t high enough to justify more than that. If I was working the front desk at the Herald, I&#8217;d either ignore it and get back to my Youtube viewing, or just kick it upstairs and let the bureaucrats in facilities deal with it. Yes, I&#8217;m being totally lazy and &#8220;not dedicated&#8221;, but for $12/hr and no benefits, you&#8217;re only going to get so much out of me. I&#8217;d rather spend my effort on something more meaningful, ya know?</p>

<p>Getting worked up about people shooting photos in public places is a complete waste of one&#8217;s energy. There&#8217;s so much more out there to expend effort on. Plus, if you think about it, the camera is ubiquitous now. If something is not recorded, that is an unusual set of circumstances indeed. In a society such as ours, there&#8217;s at least one camera recording the scene at all times in any given public location. The ethics of such ubiquitous recording? Well, that&#8217;s another debate entirely.</p>

<p>But such recording shouldn&#8217;t be feared. If you don&#8217;t want it recorded, don&#8217;t put it in a public location.</p>

<p>I was doing a little digging today, and happened upon this little gem from when I was just getting started in my club shooting days.</p>

<p>Shot on film at South Beach&#8217;s then-notorious afterhours, called The Mix, I took it for a <em>class project</em> at UM no less.</p>

<p>The above is one of my favorite images that I&#8217;ve taken. The gear used consisted of a $200 Pentax ZX-5n film SLR, a roll of $8 Fuji 400 film I bought in a drugstore, and an $80 chunk of Sigma glass with no special features other than a macro function. It shows the Metromover tracks near the original location of Club Space, looking south towards Brickell. This was prior to the AA Arena, the &#8220;Biscayne Wall&#8221; of condos such as Ten Museum Park, 900 Biscayne, The Everglades, and so on, as well as more recent additions like The Marquis. Almost a Miami of old at this point.</p>

<p>I got into a discussion just now over on <a href="http://forum.talknightlife.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=19857">Talk Nightlife</a> with James, founder of <a href="http://soulofmiami.org/">Soul of Miami</a> about some of the trials and tribulations of the photographers and photo editors in the Olympics. I linked on over to a <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2012/08/10/click-edit-crop-or-drop/">blog post on Reuters</a> about the workflow of their on-site photo team. James&#8217; comment was that it was fascinating, but essentially <strong>&#8220;It really does not seem like they could possibly be getting paid enough for that.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>I love my current car. The W210 Mercedes-Benz E320 is a solid performer. A cruiser if you will, it&#8217;s built for cruising the highways at speed. I&#8217;m not gonna beat an SLS off the line in acceleration, but I can easily cruise at 85+ MPH in the express lanes on I-95 without difficulty.</p>

<p>That being said, when I go out to shoot at a nightclub, I&#8217;m hesitant to take it out. Parking in a safe area is costly, and of course presents several safety concerns. No matter how &#8216;secure&#8217; a lot is, there&#8217;s still a fair amount of unmonitored traffic shuffling in and out of a lot during the course of a night, any of them whom could be a potential vandal or thief, looking for a score. Or even someone who just isn&#8217;t looking where they are going and decides that it&#8217;s time to bump into my vehicle.</p>

<p>So, when I go out to shoot, I usually take the cab, or the bus. Living just off of Biscayne Boulevard makes both options doable.</p>

<p>Both those options have negatives though.</p>

<p>Alex, as some of my fans know, provides excellent graphic design work (including my own logo), and Michael is a prominent fashion and editorial photographer here in Miami.</p>

<p>One of the most common questions that anyone in the photo or video industry gets asked, is, &#8221;<em>What sort of gear do you use?</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s a reasonable question. The general public and professionals alike like to know that sort of thing, and it&#8217;s a good conversation starter with anyone in the visual arts.</p>

<p>Me? What do I use?</p>

<p>One of my pet peeves since moving here ages ago has been the scooter rider.</p>

<p>Now, I recognize the utility of the scooter. It&#8217;s light, efficient, and you can stow it almost
anywhere when not in use. Plus, you don&#8217;t need insurance, and LEOs tend to leave you be.</p>

<p>It is probably the last one which makes scooter riders so obnoxious&#8230;</p>

<p><b>Support this site! Buy a print of the Miami Skyline pictured above over at my <a href="http://fineartamerica.com/featured/downtown-miami-2012-dan-vidal.html">FAA Gallery</a>.</b></p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a year since I&#8217;ve gotten back to Miami. I beat to death the <a href="http://dvdigital.tumblr.com/post/9305311687/miami-versus-vegas-since-ive-been-back-people">differences between Miami and Vegas</a>
over on my old Tumblr, so I won&#8217;t get into it here all over again.</p>

<p>In a nutshell though, absence made the heart grow fonder, and despite the faults of Miami, I&#8217;m still glad I came back.</p>

<p>A lot of people rain on Miami&#8217;s parade at any opportunity. The &#8220;lack of culture&#8221; and the lack of &#8220;real&#8221; opportunities outside of the world of
hospitality and tourism usually factor into most people&#8217;s discussions about the downsides of living in this area.</p>
