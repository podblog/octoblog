<p>iOS 6 allows iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 users to take panoramas using the native Camera App. It&#8217;s kinda cool.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>I&#8217;m actually very impressed with the results, considering it&#8217;s generated with the camera inside of a phone. There&#8217;s noise and so forth, but as a quick &#8220;live&#8221; panoramic tool, it is great.</p>

<p>Yes, I&#8217;m aware apps exist that do this anyways on both iOS and Android, but this functionality baked in, as it were, is pretty nifty. It also allows for smoother integration in terms of sending out via email or social media.</p>

<p>Now, even more so, the death of the pocket camera is imminent. An iPhone can take awesome images, as well as being a general-purpose pocket computer/communicator. The market in cameras will define itself by three tiers:</p>

<blockquote><p>DSLRs</p></blockquote>


<p>Pretty much what you see today. Digital still/video cameras with their roots in film SLRs, with the same accessories and lens systems.</p>

<blockquote><p>Compact &#8220;rangefinder&#8221; style cameras.</p></blockquote>


<p>Small bodies with or without interchangeable lenses with a large sensor. Think of the Sony NEX line or Canon&#8217;s EOS-M. You&#8217;ll see pros pick these up as a secondary or a &#8220;stealth&#8221; camera. And well-heeled hobbyists who want a nice system but without the bulk of a DSLR.</p>

<blockquote><p>Cameras built into smartphones and tablets.</p></blockquote>


<p>The iPhone 4s and the forthcoming iPhone 5 cameras are superb. Except for the flash function, it still sucks. But if you know what you are doing, who needs flash? There&#8217;s apps that allow full manual control of the cameras, too. So there&#8217;s your pocket camera solution.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/12/when-did-the-dj-become-more-important-than-the-crowd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/pete-5312.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Thanks!'" ></p>

<p>A random blog post over at <a href="http://www.faithfanzine.com/?p=1590">Faith Fanzine</a> caught my eye today. One quote from the article summed it up:</p>

<blockquote><p>When did we start watching a DJ instead of dancing with our mates , why do we put up with idiotic people taking up the floor who are filming the DJ ,why is the best dance floors now being cut to ribbons to provide extra table space for naff VIPâ€™s ( Pacha in Ibiza hang your head in shame ) ,people with more money than taste and who in some extreme situations in the US have had DJs thrown off the decks because they did not like the music .</p></blockquote>


<p>Yes, when did we stop dancing?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>I can&#8217;t dance, that&#8217;s a given. I pop around and do monkey moves, get embarrassed, and then I shuffle off to the side. But in the end, I&#8217;m still interacting with the crowd and my friends, and squeezing in a few photo ops as I mix and mingle. I take a few (OK a lot in some cases!) photos of the DJ, but I&#8217;m not in the middle of the dancefloor gawking at the booth the entire night.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually part of the reason I prefer clubs to the current form of dance music experience, the festival/concert setup.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://seenightlife.com/photos/5595/original_MIA-6086.jpg" width="427" height="640"></p>

<p>In those setups, there is a stage, and a general admission &#8220;pit&#8221;, much like a rock concert. The setup works well for rock concerts, since the whole point of a live musical act performing on stage is so you can see them work their instruments and sing. The act of a DJ mixing, no matter what tools they use, is generally a very passive act, and doesn&#8217;t lend itself much to a rock-performance aesthetic, no matter how much jumping around and handwaving the DJ is doing. Anything more than that (I&#8217;m looking at you, Aoki), smacks of being too contrived and &#8220;trying too hard&#8221;. Essentially the guy playing other people&#8217;s music in the club has been placed in the center of a stage usually reserved for rockstars. And no matter how many pretty LED screens and image-mapped 3D renderings one throws up there, it comes down to that he&#8217;s still up there playing back prerecorded sounds in a predetermined sequence. And a lot of DJs in concert situations don&#8217;t even alter their playlists much from date to date. Zero musical flexibility. Might as well put an iPhone up there and play a prerecorded mix.</p>

<p>Plus, the shows are often at capacity, so there is actually zero room for dancing, and certainly no room for social interaction, since everyone is either focused on the guy pressing play on their laptop, or has their head buried in their phone, stroking their ego on Facebook.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m generally regarded as a borderline sociopathic personality. However, I do value social interaction when I&#8217;m out for a night of entertainment. It&#8217;s why I value the few clubs left that actually encourage social discourse and interaction. Venues in town like Space, the Vagabond, and so forth, while they book DJ talent, don&#8217;t rely on the DJ exclusively to drive their business. Some of my best nights out have been with the local guys on the decks, and I&#8217;m just there with my friends, having a good time. Some DJs still get it. <a href="http://seenightlife.com/users/pod/albums/pete-tong-at-space">Pete Tong</a> is a great example. This past weekend, he took to the decks at Space. No grandstanding, no tricks, he just played a great soundtrack to a night/morning out, and the crowd responded in kind. People were dancing, socializing, and having a good time, but not buried in their phones or gawking at the booth for hours on end. So there&#8217;s hope&#8230;</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s save the rockstar setup for the rockstars.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/11/the-obligatory-september-11th-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/dade.png" width="538" height="359" title="'September 11th Post'" ></p>

<p>Today is the 11th Anniversary of the September 11th attacks on New York City. The social media sphere is filled with the obligatory graphics and memes of eagles, the WTC towers, and our soldiers deployed in Afghanistan. However, it was the above statement by my friend Dade which made the most sense thus far.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the actual attack on New York on that fateful Tuesday morning was, in and of itself, a disaster. Over 3000 people died in what was the most brutal attack on American soil since the founding of the country.</p>

<p>However, as Dade said, the real disaster is in how it has been handled since then.</p>

<p>9/11 has become the crutch of American society. Where once we would keep moving forward in the face of adversity, we now cower behind closed doors, and beg our elected officials to do something, anything, to rid the world of the supposed terrorist menace, regardless of the implications to our liberties and our freedoms.</p>

<p>Have we become that timid and complacent that we will give up our essential freedoms and liberties just in the name of the illusion of safety? I say illusion since if someone wants to attack us on our own soil, they will, regardless of the safeguards put into place. I think, at the end of the day, what America can&#8217;t cope with is the sobering realization that the world is rather ambivalent to our lifestyle and values. The bulk of the world doesn&#8217;t have the time or the energy to waste on hating us. Sure, a few neckbeards in the Middle East might march around in circles screaming &#8220;Death to the Great Satan&#8221; (that&#8217;s us, by the way!), but they don&#8217;t represent the majority opinion. The people in the Middle East, in general, are too busy with their daily activities to waste much energy screaming about us. They have families, jobs, and lives, just like we do.</p>

<p>Same for the rest of the world. No one cares. They just want what&#8217;s best for them, and what&#8217;s best for them doesn&#8217;t involve chanting overused slogans in town squares and burning American flags. Newsflash, most of those actions are staged and cleverly edited to overexpose the threat, making it easier for our government to pass senseless legislation like the PATRIOT Act, and the various regulations that enable agencies like the TSA to exist.</p>

<p>But, as long as the government appears to be doing something about the problem (if there even is a problem), the people are timid and complacent. As long as American Idol continues to broadcast, and people can continue to measure their self-worth in Facebook Likes and Klout scores, the people are cowed into submission, and they don&#8217;t even know it. It&#8217;s a modern day equivalent of bread and circuses. There&#8217;s an enemy we can all get riled up about (the supposed beard with the AK-47), and we have our circuses in the form of social networks and mindless reality shows. Sure, such things existed before September 11, 2001, but it wasn&#8217;t nearly as execrable as it was after the attacks. Even Pearl Harbor, which led to an actual global conflict, didn&#8217;t precipitate the wholesale revocation of civil liberties, and the weakening of our resolve. If anything, Pearl Harbor served as a catalyst for us to defend those freedoms. Maybe terming those people &#8220;The Greatest Generation&#8221; isn&#8217;t such aÂ´clichÃ©d term after all. I can only wonder what future historians will term our generation.</p>

<p>They&#8217;ll have to make sure it&#8217;s 140 characters or shorter so it fits in a tweet, I can tell you that much.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/10/the-free-flow-of-opinion</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/keys-4655.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Above The Indian Key Channel Bridge - hey it is symbolic of the article'" ></p>

<p>For those of you who maybe only know me through this blog, I also am responsible for the operation of a little web forum called <a href="http://talknightlife.com/">Talk Nightlife</a>.</p>

<p>The reason I mention it in this context is because I actually picked up a few readers over the weekend based on my <a href="http://www.dan-vidal.com/blog/2012/09/08/wynwood-artwalk-too-hot-to-handle/">prior post about Artwalk</a>. A Twitter user called <a href="http://twitter.com/walkwynwood">WalkWynwood</a> must have had a Google Alert set up for Artwalk commentary, and kindly tweeted out my blog post on the good and bad of Artwalk. So, I picked up a few readers who only probably know me through this blog, and not the scandalous &#8220;TNL&#8221;.</p>

<p>TNL has actually been an outlet of mine for five years, as of next Monday. It is probably the only nightlife-related resource on the internet not nominally subject to the whims of advertisers.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As a little bit of a backgrounder, TNL was founded in September of 2007, by refugees from another nightlife website, the now-defunct Cooljunkie. In existence since 2000, &#8220;CJ&#8221; (we love our acronyms!) was an independent site about Miami and South Beach nightlife and culture, founded by two English expats and <a href="http://ryanalynporter.com">the guy who helped me put this blog up.</a> It was actually a blog before blogs were blogs. And there was a notoriously popular forum component. I was bought on in mid-2001 as an itinerant photographer/writer. Unpaid at first, though the sites founders, Nick and Sarah, actually promoted the hell out of me and got me work as my unofficial &#8220;agents&#8221;. It was a fair trade in my mind.</p>

<p>Unlike most web projects, there was a final payoff. In 2005, CJ was bought out by out-of-state rival Clubplanet, aka &#8220;CP&#8221;. Owned by the now-defunct Track Entertainment, CP was a national web forum about nightlife and clubs, with their focus city being New York. There were a few articles in there but no one really bothered to read them. Much like CJ, the popular part of CP was the community aspect. CP bought out CJ because CP wished to have a Miami presence, and and we at CJ kept stopping them. The Miami clubs (our advertisers) were very loyal to us. So, the old logic of &#8220;if you can&#8217;t beat &#8216;em, join &#8216;em&#8221;, kicked in. CP made us an offer we couldn&#8217;t refuse (payouts, equity in Track, and continued paid employment) and suddenly we found ourselves with corporate patronage.</p>

<p>Initially the operations continued as is, but with a budget. CJ was maintained as a business unit of it&#8217;s own, and we were free to keep doing business, as it were, but with funding. It seemed ideal.</p>

<p>However, reality soon reared it&#8217;s ugly head. CJ had a very active forum community component. Around Miami, it was feared by club owners, DJs, and promoters. Ugly secrets about nightlife routinely got out on the forums, much to the chagrin of the venues, some of which were advertisers. And even though you can&#8217;t un-ring a bell, we routinely censored or deleted posts that could cast our key advertisers in a bad light. Editorial and community definitely were not separate from advertising. And, we couldn&#8217;t maintain without these advertisers.</p>

<p>As time went on, eventually the corporate powers-that-be in New York wanted to take direct control over the Miami operations of CJ. That, and a few other things I&#8217;m not at liberty to mention (it went all the way to federal court at the end&#8230;), led to myself and the key players in CJ to depart the company, without being able to take CJ with us since it no longer was ours.</p>

<p>So, through a few machinations, we ended up under the corporate umbrella of one of the rivals to Track in the entertainment and media space. And thus, it was decided, with their patronage, to explicitly fund and found a website to counter the influence of CJ that we had built. Basically, we had to build something to destroy something else we built.</p>

<p>So, after a little thought, we realized that the most popular part of CJ was the forum, by a factor of four. People didn&#8217;t go for the articles or even my photos, it was the community part they liked. They liked to be able to post their thoughts, and read the thoughts of others. The more controversial, the better. So, with that in mind, Talk Nightlife was born in September of 2007.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/tnl.jpg" width="960" height="632" title="'TNL'" ></p>

<p>Initially, we had the goals, and the requirement from the powers-that-be above, to get some advertisers on board and pay for the investment made to bring the website to life. There was a forum component, a guide to local events, and my photo gallery. And our mission was to keep it as open as possible, since it&#8217;s what drew people to the site ultimately.</p>

<p>However, it did prove to be a very tricky, and ultimately unsuccessful balance. Advertisers simply weren&#8217;t interested in being on a site where, a few lines down, there were statements that weren&#8217;t necessarily supportive of them. The Opium Group, for example, would not place an ad, since they were regularly subject to criticism within the site. The whole &#8220;user-generated content&#8221; statement didn&#8217;t hold water with them, since it was expected that us site operators would put our bank accounts before our principles, like good Americans.</p>

<p>After awhile, TNL as a financial priority fell by the wayside. Other web projects financed by the investor in TNL started to bear massive fruit, and took a lot of the pressure off of TNL itself. The investor only really cared that we made money for the &#8220;department&#8221;, not that specific projects made money.</p>

<p>And besides, TNL was accomplishing one mission goal, to sink and destroy CJ, which it did admirably. CJ was rendered defunct, useless, and irrelevant to the discourse in nightlife. TNL slid into a parking orbit, and became the &#8220;drama magnet&#8221;, where it remains today, and is arguably the least-restricted source of nightclub news on the internet.</p>

<p>Now, without a steady source of income (there are advertisers but the ads are usually in-kind or severely discounted), how does the site exist? Well, the site itself costs next to nothing to run. Hosting is inconsequentially cheap, and the maintenance performed by myself and Ryan is negligible. The only screwups are on the side of the hosting service, and we just wait those out. And, the investors lost interest in the site long ago, so there it sits. TNL only really keeps ticking over through a fortuitous set of circumstances. Ryan and I only keep it running because it&#8217;s an interesting social experiment, and a distraction from our more mundane tasks. And I personally consider it a necessity in the nightlife industry, someone has to provide an unrestricted outlet.</p>

<p>Now, it&#8217;s not to say TNL is uncensored. It&#8217;s &#8220;self-censored&#8221;. Each and every user has the ability to edit their own posts if they choose. Clubs could, in theory, pressure users directly to edit their words, if it came down to it. Now, the interesting thing is, since the advent of Facebook and Twitter, clubs focus almost exclusively on those, leaving old-style forums like TNL off their radars. I suppose I should thank Facebook for taking the heat off of us.</p>

<p>However, the question on occasion does come up, are we interested in making money off of the site? The usual answer is no, since we know that if the site is &#8220;monetized&#8221;, eventually advertisers, even if they aren&#8217;t directly insulted, will object to being placed close to controversial content. While TNL is self-censoring, as I mentioned, most people choose not to censor themselves. Insults, defamation, and even outright hate speech happen on TNL. It&#8217;s the price of freedom I guess. I personally couldn&#8217;t see a well-known advertiser like Bacardi wanting to have an ad positioned near the postings of someone who regularly ridicules minorities. Yes, there&#8217;s someone on TNL who does that. We don&#8217;t censor him, the community does. But the posts still remain.</p>

<p>So, TNL essentially remains free because we&#8217;re choosing to not use it to make money.</p>

<p>Which begs the question, can a truly free source of information exist, and still make a profit? Or are truly free sources of information condemned to always operating at a loss, relying on the charity of others to merely exist?</p>

<p>With that in mind, I think we&#8217;re at a point now in the evolution of the internet, where this is actually less and less of a question. It does not cost much money to operate a site. This blog is a perfect example of it. It is hosted on <a href="http://heroku.com">Heroku</a> which is a platform-as-a-service provider. They provide the infrastructure, and I provide the application, which, in this case, is this blog. Heroku lives in the cloud and charges me for only what I use. This blog is currently so low-impact I have yet to incur a fee. I&#8217;m not privy to why Heroku does this, but it may be a remnant of the <a href="http://www.dan-vidal.com/blog/2012/08/22/how-it-was/">community spirit</a> which characterized the early days of the modern internet era, or it might just be too much damn trouble to monitor usage as such a fine-grained level, so it&#8217;s easier to let me squat here for free rather than charge me. And the actual pretty pictures are hosted over on <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/">Amazon S3</a>, which is another large-scale cloud effort, and my storage bill is less than a dollar so far. And, this blog is powered by <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, which is a free, open source blog platform. The breaks there are that there is no formal support or upgrade structure. The programmer of Octopress has no obligation to help me out.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, computing resources and storage are so cheap that maybe nowadays, uncensored and free channels of expression are easier to justify? Cheap hosting, cheap storage, and cheap or free publishing mechanisms. If TNL ever got the rug pulled out from under it, would it be as big of a disaster as some think? I used to think so. We went through the disaster once when we transitioned from CJ to TNL. It took awhile and a fair bit of investment to get the community to move over and to get everything pointed in the right direction. But that was 2007. Nowadays, a TNL-like service could be tossed up for a negligible investment, to the point one person could do it, without requiring a business plan or a way to make back the few dollars per year it costs to run.
Hm, maybe the community spirit is still around in a way. That&#8217;s something. Whether it&#8217;s about something inconsequential like nightlife, or something meaningful like politics, war, or social causes, truly free information outlets are necessary to a society that wants to call itself free. In my mind, the free flow of thought and ideas is more important than the balance sheet. Even though in today&#8217;s society it&#8217;s very difficult to put your ideals above your daily needs. Ideals don&#8217;t put food on the table all the time.</p>

<p>And yes, this was my non-angry blog post for today. I don&#8217;t think I got that worked up, did I? And happy fifth birthday Talk Nightlife. You&#8217;re my contentious little foster child. Also, if you&#8217;re of a mind and interested, we&#8217;re putting together a little shindig somewhere on the 28th of September. Keep checking <a href="http://forum.talknightlife.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=20004&st=0&sk=t&sd=a">this thread on TNL</a> for details. It&#8217;s not an official event since we don&#8217;t do official anything. Oh, and sign up if you want. Just mention you read about TNL on here and I&#8217;ll process the login right away.</p>

<p>Sidebar (because it is how I write on this blog): Certain details about TNL I&#8217;ve left intentionally vague. Why? Well, anyone with half a brain knows who was originally behind TNL and who put the money in. However, the general feeling at the time was that their involvement be minimized in public, and it was never discussed further as time went on. Those requests still remain in force from where I sit, even if the investing parties don&#8217;t remember or don&#8217;t care. I&#8217;m &#8220;having some class&#8221; with regards to that. I&#8217;m definitely grateful for their initial involvement though. I got to help raise a bastard child of a website. If I hear otherwise, I&#8217;ll let you know.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/artwalk.jpg" width="960" height="960" title="'Artwalk Wynwood Artwalk Miami'" ></p>

<p>Though I guess I could be considered part of the Miami art community, I almost never go to Artwalk in Wynwood. I&#8217;m usually busy Saturday nights, or I consider my rare downtime more valuable than bouncing from gallery to gallery, most of which probably wouldn&#8217;t exhibit anything I do. Photography is sort of underrepresented at Artwalk, but that&#8217;s for another rant.</p>

<p>So anyways, the rare times I go to it are last-minute call-ups like I did earlier tonight.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I got a text from my good friend <strong>Emi Guerra</strong>, he wanted to go out and cruise Artwalk and meet some of the Miami art community to tell them about his forthcoming <strong>UR1 Festival</strong>, the big music and art festival taking place on December 8th and 9th during Art Basel. The big announcement of the lineup is Monday, even though it has been leaked. So I won&#8217;t post it here since you can find it <a href="http://forum.talknightlife.com/">elsewhere.</a>.</p>

<p>But anyways, he wanted to go out and see the artists and art people. Makes sense if you are throwing an art-oriented festival. And, since I&#8217;m kinda in touch with these people (am I?) he invited me along.</p>

<p>So, I jumped into the 210 and zipped on down Biscayne to Wynwood.</p>

<p>Once I got to the area, what a bloody mission. Traffic was at a gridlocked standstill, and there were throngs of people out and about, to the point where Northwest 2nd Avenue was a pedestrian thoroughfare. I was supposed to meet Emi and his UR1 team at Wynwood Walls, and I ended up having to park about seven blocks away. I&#8217;m a healthy boy now so it&#8217;s no big deal, but it&#8217;s the principle. And I will not valet. The 210 isn&#8217;t an SLS or an E 63, but it&#8217;s my baby and no one except me and the crew at <a href="http://masterclassauto.com/">Masterclass Auto</a> touches the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Some have called for the major streets of Wynwood to be closed off to automotive traffic during Artwalk. 100 percent, yes. Please. Do this. Commissioner Sarnoff, it&#8217;s your district (for now), make it happen. The cops have their hands full pushing vehicular and pedestrian traffic around, and it&#8217;s a complete cluster down there, and it actually hampers the enjoyment of Artwalk.</p>

<p>So yes, Artwalk has truly exploded into a Miami social phenomenon. We officially have an art scene here as far as I&#8217;m concerned. Go us.</p>

<p>However, I finally did get situated, and met Emi, along with UR1&#8217;s Jackie Richie, Emi&#8217;s assistant Andrea, Alex Martinez of <a href="http://deepsleepstudio.com">Deepsleep</a>, and a few other scene people I know at Wynwood Walls, which was &#8220;at capacty&#8221; and had this weird dining area with a velvet rope and such set up.</p>

<p>They gotta update the artwork there. It&#8217;s been the same since I last went to Artwalk (oddly enough with Emi&#8217;s brother, Eddy) over two years ago. I&#8217;ll paint a wall. It won&#8217;t be anything &#8220;arty&#8221;, but it will be something from my mind. I&#8217;ll mention it here even.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, everyone was out in force. Now, was everyone into the art? Hardly. Most people &#8220;Artwalking&#8221; couldn&#8217;t tell you if that was a piece by Nagelbett or Britto. They are out for the social experience. Emi phrased it best when he said, &#8220;They are out for something to do, and it&#8217;s cheap to go to Artwalk. Shit is expensive these days&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>He hit the nail on the head. Shit is expensive these days. Dinner for two will run you $100 or more. A night out at a club, even Space, will run you $100 per person (drinks, cover, and so on) or more if you VIP it. Having fun costs money!</p>

<p>But not at Artwalk. The galleries often have cash bars and/or free (albeit low-quality) booze on hand. They usually arrange a sponsorship or something. And the food trucks are out in force, and the food is cheap, though I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily trust it. Yeah, the modern food trucks have all the amenities, but it&#8217;s still a food truck, ya know? We called &#8216;em the &#8220;roach coaches&#8221; back in Jersey. Note to food truck owners, I&#8217;m not saying that your food truck has roaches. If you&#8217;re that concerned about what I said, you probably have something to hide. Be confident in your product and people talking shit, like me, won&#8217;t affect your business. Let freedom ring.</p>

<p>But yes, anyways, people are out for Artwalk because it&#8217;s cheap, interesting, and there&#8217;s a good social dynamic. And the galleries and artists put up with it since it will get their works exposed to the five percent of the people who actually know their art and are in a position to do something about it.</p>

<p>And yes, please block off the streets. Artwalk is now truly a &#8220;phenomenon&#8221; and it needs to be handled properly. Our art scene is finally getting some worldwide respect, and it&#8217;d be a shame if logistical squabbles killed off a major component of it.</p>

<p>Maybe I should run for the City Commission and make Artwalk one of my campaign platforms&#8230;</p>

<p>Dan Vidal For District 2 Commissioner!</p>

<p>Sidebar: Yes, I&#8217;m aware the issues mentioned here are old. But these first few articles on my blog are kind of for SEO purposes, as well as stuff that is on my mind, regardless of when it happened. It&#8217;s my blog, after all.</p>

<p>Sidebar 2: Yes, this devolved into a rant. In a nutshell, I did have fun at Artwalk. The food truck area is a great concept. Get &#8216;em all in one place. Also, good seeing the <a href="http://car2go.com/">Miami Car2Go</a> people out&#8230;thanks for the T-shirt guys.</p>

    <link href="http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/on-the-premise-of-exclusivity/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-06T19:12:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/on-the-premise-of-exclusivity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ex.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'MK II overlooking Space'" ></p>

<p>Over the years, a lot of people have been under the mistaken assumption that I&#8217;ve been the &#8220;exclusive&#8221; photographer for venues and events I&#8217;ve worked with.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t enforce or expect exclusivity, and here&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At the root of it all, I&#8217;m only one person. I can only be in so many places within a venue at once, especially if it&#8217;s a large scale venue such as Space. I&#8217;ll be upstairs on the Terrace, but the Loft might be uncovered, or the Ballroom. There isn&#8217;t money in the budget to clone me.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that photographers prior to me didn&#8217;t enforce exclusivity with their venue clients was an enormous boost to me being able to do what I do today. If they hadn&#8217;t left that door open, I might not have been as far along as I am today. However, back when I got started, the position/gig of &#8220;club photographer&#8221; was a rare one indeed. More on that in a minute.</p>

<p>And, if I were a large-scale venue manager/owner, and I had it in the budget, I would definitely want multiple photographic perspectives on what was going on that evening. Each and every person who picks up a camera has their own thoughts and ideas on how an image should come out, and it is a definite advertising boon to have those multiple perspectives represented. And in the case of email-harvesting sites posing as photo sites, the venue gets multiple sources of data. I don&#8217;t necessarily approve of the tactic, but it is what it is, and if I were a venue owner or manager, I would avail myself of a few of those sites.</p>

<p>Finally, to be honest, enforcing exclusivity and being &#8220;the guy&#8221; is a real <em>pain</em>. You&#8217;re expected to be everywhere at once, cover the event exactly in the style the client wants, which may not be your style, and the task of club photographer rapidly turns from a fun profession to a &#8220;job&#8221;, i.e. something you have to do to make money. And, frankly, I can think of many healthier activities that aren&#8217;t fun to do at all, that would earn me the same money or more that I do documenting the nightclub scene. I do it primarily because I love to do it, and the financial benefits are just the icing on the cake. You don&#8217;t see people clamoring to spend thousands of dollars on camera equipment just to take it into a smoke-filled room with loud music and sloppy drunk people because it&#8217;s a job.</p>

<p>However, the situation today could be regarded as a little different. Since I got started, the position of club photographer has gone from a rare job description, to one of almost ubiquity. Often, the last thing a party would consider is booking a photographer to document an event. It was usually a &#8220;6 PM on the night of the event&#8221; request, if they thought about it at all. Of course the internet changed that.</p>

<p>Now, if you throw a party at a club, it&#8217;s expected that you will have at least one or two guys on hand to document the event. However, some venues tend to go a little overboard, thinking any exposure is good, and let any guy with an SLR and an excuse into the venue. With the modern set of circumstances in mind, I&#8217;d at least require that the shooter have a full-fledged website (and not just a Facebook page or Flickr gallery) with which their images were to be posted. And, I&#8217;d probably cap the amount of shooters within a venue to a certain amount to avoid &#8220;shooting gallery&#8221; syndrome where there is, in fact, ten or more shooters in a venue. So, exclusivity on one person, not so much, but not overkill like some places are now. Especially if you add in everyone with their iPhones blazing away. But that&#8217;s for another rant.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the club shooting world, keep shooting. Don&#8217;t expect or enforce exclusivity though, it&#8217;s not practical and definitely not in the spirit of things. There&#8217;s enough subject matter for all (well, most) of us.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/jive-4963.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Guy yelling at Adam'" ></p>

<p>I like shooting live concerts. There&#8217;s more than one guy or girl on stage, and there&#8217;s a lot of activity to document, from the vocalist to the instrumentalists, there&#8217;s always someone moving about and in action. Plus, the lighting can&#8217;t be argued with since the whole point of them being lit is to be seen. I actually like that almost every Tuesday I get to shoot Jive at Blue Martini Brickell.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It&#8217;s a singing contest of sorts, but it brings out some real talent. Whether they are there for fun or hoping for a big break, I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s a fun event to shoot. The band, Higher Ground, is on point with their covers, so it gives the contestants a real thrill to have a genuine live band behind them. And the dynamics of shooting it are a welcome change from my usual club shooting.</p>

<p>Not that I mind the DJ-oriented shooting. It&#8217;s interesting, still after all these years, even with the proliferation of the DJ-as-rockstar during this current dance music bubble. Though some of these guys, it&#8217;s gone to their heads.</p>

<p>When I first started this, over a decade ago, DJs kind of knew where they fit in within the musical ecosystem. They were curators and purveyors of music. Even if they produced their own tracks, they were still sought after and regarded first and foremost, as musical librarians of a sort. You went to a specific DJ&#8217;s club night to hear new music since you trusted their musical taste was in line with yours. The end result was that you hopefully would go out to the record store the next day and purchase the tracks you heard. Even when the internet flipped the record store idea on it&#8217;s face, the hope was you&#8217;d go to your online record shop and do the same.</p>

<p>Then came the rockstar phenomenon. DJs demanded more and more salaries, for correspondingly less work. Even disregarding automation, most DJs are content to go from A to B and back again and ask for a $50,000 paycheck. I can remember when DJs would get paid a tenth of that, and do far more work behind the decks, even when the change from vinyl to CDs happened. And most of all, DJs knew where they fit in the scheme of things. They knew their job was to provide the soundtrack for a night out, not be the sole focus of a night out. They helped maintain the dynamic of providing great music to a party. Now, unfortunately, we&#8217;re in a sort of twilight zone where DJs get stage setups that rival those of genuine musicians, all to frame them pressing some keys on a Macbook. Now, some of the kids might argue that they&#8217;re &#8220;really doing something&#8221; up there, but the sad fact is, it&#8217;s all just sequencing and basic mixing. Very few DJs are actually doing anything innovative with the tools at hand. Though, those that are, ironically enough, are working the club scene and not about being the glory hogs of the world. You have veterans like Carl Cox who still throw down ten hour sets, working three or four inputs at once, and creating new compositions on the fly. And you have one of my favorites, the legendary Pete Tong, who generally eschews the festival scene, preferring to focus on his BBC show, and bringing the newest records and all the classics to the clubs. He knows he&#8217;s there to drive the dancefloor and show the party people a good time. One of the best sets I&#8217;ve heard recently was his WMC session at Space. He&#8217;ll actually be on the very same Terrace this coming weekend. I personally can&#8217;t wait, and I&#8217;m at the point know where I&#8217;m pretty jaded and it takes a lot to get me excited with regards to DJs.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#8217;s why I get a kick out of a little party like Jive. It&#8217;s a bunch of people having a good time and not taking everything so seriously. The cash prize ($200) isn&#8217;t going to solve world hunger or put a kid through college, so the people participating are usually just up there to have a good time. I think in the end if the rockstar DJs in the world remember that&#8217;s all people really want, we can get back to some sort of rationality in the dance club scene. It&#8217;s ironic, the live music scene in general (not just little singing contests in Brickell!) from what I can see is actually getting more down to earth, whereas DJs are getting more and more egotistical in their demands. Even Axl Rose in his prime would be envious of some of these guys&#8217; riders. But, from where I sit, I see it as a bubble. I&#8217;m confident the DJ world will get back to reality soon.</p>

<p>Oh and a disclaimer, I do sincerely appreciate what some DJs do on and off the decks. Those guys usually end up in my iPhone playlist. I&#8217;ll post it up someday. I think I do have an audio player plugin. Actually yeah I do. Note to self, start posting some sets of genuinely good DJs. But if any of you dear readers want a good place to start, just hunt out the sets of (in no particular order): Pete Tong, Victor Calderone, Roger Sanchez, The Martinez Brothers, Dennis Ferrer, Danny Tenaglia, Loco Dice, Marco Carola, Oscar G, Patrick M, Mark M (Miami), Trent Cantrelle, the Cocodrills, Louie Vega, Frankie Knuckles, and Eric Prydz to name a few.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll try and kick up a favorite mix of mine in the next few days. I gotta see how it will affect my S3 bill. And also if there&#8217;s anything copyright-related I might have to worry about.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ldw-4518.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Jordyn at Space'" ></p>

<p>Sometimes you nail it, sometimes you don&#8217;t. You&#8217;re not always going to score the perfect shot each and every time.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people who pick up a camera get hung up on that. While yes, you try to capture the best image you can at a given moment, sometimes you have to work with what is there.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And sometimes that has to be enough.</p>

<p>Nightlife and concert photography straddles a line between photojournalism and staged photo performance. You can have as much control or as little control as you want in a lot of cases.</p>

<p>Take the image above for example. It is one of the quintessential elements of the modern nightclub, the dancer. Jordyn here is one of the regular girls at Space these days. Through a combination of knowing how my images come out, and being expertly lit by Space&#8217;s lighting designers, the image here straddles the line between a &#8220;spur of the moment&#8221; shot and a staged image. It is a spur-of-the-moment since I usually don&#8217;t request specific lighting cues for the dancers at Space. I could, since I maintain a good rapport with Dennis, Gabriel, and Mike, but they have their &#8220;canvas&#8221; to work their art on and I&#8217;d feel like I was interfering if I constantly requested specific lighting cues. Their goal is to light Jordyn in the most flattering way possible, and they succeed, so I leave it at that. When her or any of the other girls get up on the box, I know they will be lit well. So, it is staged, yes, but staged without the interference of me coordinating the lighting.</p>

<p>Now, on occasion, I will ask for specifics from the techs, of course. If I&#8217;m assigned to capture a specific image of a performer or DJ, then we will plan ahead. Staging the image gets me paid, and makes for a happy client. However, it&#8217;s certainly not photojournalism.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ldw-4573.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Reboot aka Frank at Space'" ></p>

<p>My preference is to work with what is there, usually. I like to document the scene as it is. For example, the image of Reboot (Frank) above. What you see is what was actually happening. Frank was lining up his tracks for the next mix as the sun was rising over the Terrace at Space. No fancy lighting tricks, as a matter of fact, Gabriel had left to go to the bathroom and the lighting console was temporarily unmanned. Aesthetically, the image comes together, even though there may be some technical failings. Some may argue there&#8217;s a little too much noise in the image, or that the red light is a little too blotchy. However, the image was captured of one of the headliners of the morning doing his work on the decks, and the compelling nature comes from the overall composition of the image, with Frank being dominant, and the panopoly of gear adding to the atmosphere of the image, and of course, the teeming masses of people on the dancefloor below. A viewer would want to know more about what happened there, regardless of the noise or slight color issues. I documented what was there within the limits of my equipment, and I&#8217;d like to think I pulled it off. I didn&#8217;t use a flash to blow out the scene, nor did I call on one of the techs to light the booth just for me, even though I will do that on occasion. However, that wasn&#8217;t one of those occasions.</p>

<p>I worked with what I had on hand, and that was enough. At the end of the day, this presents the most accurate image of what a photographer sees. In an age of extensive photoshop work and manipulation, it&#8217;s the least any of us can do. Everyone has their own ideas and tastes about what to do in a club or concert situation, it just so happens mine is to work with what I have, and take it from there. Anything else, in my mind, is distorting reality, and I&#8217;d like to think I&#8217;m here to document reality through my vision. And sometimes the reality is that the situation is staged, and sometimes it isn&#8217;t. I think I&#8217;m safe in an ethical sense, since I&#8217;m documenting a staged situation, which usually isn&#8217;t staged for my benefit. They are pointing high-powered LED fixtures at Jordyn for the benefit of the audience, not myself. I just take advantage of the situation and fire away. While with Frank, he is not specifically lit to an ideal, but what I had to work with there was enough, as it had to be.</p>

<p>Work with what is there, and sometimes it has to be enough.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/keys-4648_blog.jpg" width="960" height="308" title="'Yellow Shark Channel'" ></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always liked going down to the Keys, especially the Lower Keys and Key West.</p>

<p>It is one of the few places I&#8217;ve been to in the US where things are truly running at a different pace. No one&#8217;s concerned about their latest Facebook status, what Justin Bieber said on Twitter, or what their Klout score (a rigged and meaningless metric by the way) is.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It&#8217;s removed from the mainland as it were, by geography, but it&#8217;s not a pig-ignorant backwater of the Ozarks populated by people who are poised to vote for Romney this coming November. You can go to Key West, relax, but not feel like you are in a premillenial timewarp. They are connected down there, they just choose not to make a big deal of it. That&#8217;s actually the way I think they feel down there, &#8220;don&#8217;t make a big deal of it&#8221;.</p>

<p>After a fairly interesting morning of shooting photos of the Labor Day Weekend event at Space, featuring DJs AN21, Robert Dietz (a true master of his craft by the way), and Reboot (aka Frank&#8230;I always call DJs by their real names), I decided to call it off around 8 AM, get some rest, and actually go out and <em>produce</em> something photographically that day. I hadn&#8217;t generated much other than nightlife-related material over the preceding few weeks, so I figured I should get to it and find an interesting slice of land to document.</p>

<p>So, I figured why not head south? I&#8217;ve had good photo experiences there before, and I&#8217;ve always made mental notes on stopping points on the way down. So around 4 PM after some much-needed rest, I jumped in the 210 and headed to the Turnpike southbound.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/tipover.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'Tip Over'" ></p>

<p>I like driving the Homestead Extension to the Florida Turnpike. It&#8217;s fairly new so the pavement hasn&#8217;t succumbed to the elements as of yet, and it&#8217;s never so congested that you are reduced to driving at a crawl. You can easily cruise at 85 MPH (keep your eyes open!) and not have to fuss with slowing down.</p>

<p>After a quick fill-up in Florida City ($4.29 a gallon for premium&#8230;), I got to the Overseas Highway proper.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/overseas.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'Blaue'" ></p>

<p>Now, if you want to talk about minor driving frustrations, the Overseas Highway is it. One lane, with a few passing zones, and a lot of people have a nasty habit of going below the speed limit. I&#8217;m not a speed demon, but I do like to keep up a good pace, ya know?</p>

<p>Anyways, things were progressing swimmingly. And it being Labor Day weekend, the whole stretch of the Keys was abuzz with activity. People were out boating, barbecuing, RVing, and just having a grand old time.</p>

<p>Around 7:30 PM or so, I started getting to what I consider the &#8220;fertile&#8221; photo-opportunity grounds of the Islamorada area of the Keys. I&#8217;ve shot there before, but this time around, the sky was extremely cooperative.</p>

<p>I saw the colors and cloud formations, and oddly enough I was very close to the site of my last great landscape piece at the Indian Key Channel. Now, unlike that fortuitous encounter in April, the parking area at Indian Key was packed with people, all in the long-weekend frame of mind. However, no one seemed to mind that I was setting up a bunch of photo equipment. Even a park ranger/Fish and Wildlife cop could care less, it seemed.</p>

<p>I had to work fast though. This was a random stop, yes, but I was here to shoot something. So, I set up, and got to it. The sun was rapidly descending. I know one of the rules of landscape and scenic photography is to get on-site hours beforehand, but sometimes you can&#8217;t make that happen. So, you have to work with what you got.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/keys-4623.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Pylons - they go south'" ></p>

<p>There was no wind threatening to carry me off into the sea, so I had a nice stable platform with which to compose. Definitely more &#8220;colorful&#8221; than my last visit. I think I&#8217;m gonna make a little &#8220;project&#8221; out of the Indian Key channel at different times of the year.</p>

<p>Then, finally, I think I nailed it. I moved to the eastern side of &#8220;that bridge&#8221;, and everything just sort of came together. The sun was below the horizon, but still, there was enough light to make the sky interesting, and the bridge became a jagged shadow across the frame. I saw it. One shot, one kill, as it were.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/keys-4648.jpg" width="960" height="1440" title="'Fire away'" ></p>

<p>This one frame made the whole trip worth the effort. They say you know you have a good photo even before you process it, and right there, I knew it. Yellow Shark Channel is officially &#8220;my spot&#8221; now. FYI, the piece above will be for sale later today at <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">my Fine Art America</a> site.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t end the day there though. I figured I was already most of the way down the highway, so I proceeded on to Key West proper.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/doppler.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'Doppler'" ></p>

<p>I made it Key West around 10 PM. The scene was in full swing, so I parked and decided to go walkabout, as it were, and take things in. I like Key West itself. It&#8217;s a modern resort town, but the whole atmosphere encourages me to relax. I&#8217;m seriously thinking about figuring out how to maintain a residence down there. It&#8217;s just a different way of life, really. You can just live your life at your own pace, and not worry about the petty bullshit which seemingly consumes Americans these days. No worrying about keeping up with the Joneses, as it were. And again, it&#8217;s not a cradle of ignorance. The whole area is connected and part of the world, they just choose not to get caught up in the &#8220;rat race&#8221;. Maybe in my old (not that old!) age I&#8217;m turning into a bum, I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>I did grab a few street scene images, and also scoped out a few potential &#8220;Residence B&#8221; places. I&#8217;d actually be into a timeshare arrangement if the circumstances I have in mind worked out. Eventually I suppose I&#8217;ll become a burnout and just live there. It&#8217;d be kinda nice. Me, a bungalow, and a boat. Though that bungalow would be pretty high-tech. I do love my toys. And I&#8217;d get one of those covers for the 210 so it&#8217;s nice and safe from the seagulls and parrots.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/sloppy.jpg" width="960" height="960" title="'sloppy'" ></p>

<p>There&#8217;s just a certain allure to it, you know? You can just kind of be there, do what you need to in order to provide shelter and the essentials of life, and not get caught up in the petty antics of society. Like I said at the start of this article, everyone, whether they are tourists or locals, seems to be just fine with letting things be. They&#8217;re not caught up in the rat race of wealth accumulation, and are just about enjoying life, and not rotting away flying a desk somewhere. Hey, if flying a desk is your thing, go for it, but I personally have other things in mind.</p>

<p>Maybe they&#8217;re on to something down there. I&#8217;ll be back more often, for sure.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/08/31/i-guess-i-am-becoming-a-car-guy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/210hella960.jpg" width="960" height="360" title="'210 Hella'" ></p>

<p>I took my E320 &#8220;the 210&#8221; in for some service at the excellent locally-owned repair shop, <a href="http://masterclassauto.com/">Masterclass Automotive</a> this morning. I got the headlamp lenses swapped for spanking new Hellas and some odd DTC codes diagnosed.</p>

<p>A year or so ago, I didn&#8217;t know what a DTC code was and I sure as hell didn&#8217;t care. Am I becoming a &#8216;car guy&#8217;?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>Those who have known me for more than a few months know, that for the longest time, I was a dedicated bus rider/taxicab user. I had a monthly Metropass (superseded by the Easy Card) for over ten years. Not out of any sense of financial restriction (well OK at some points of time, yes&#8230;), but more out of a sense of convenience.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/thebus.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'The Bus'" ></p>

<p>However, during my temporary exile to Vegas, I was pretty much forced into getting a personal vehicle. Vegas has public transport, but it only covered about 30 percent of the valley, and even then only during daytime hours. Forget about nighttime buses.</p>

<p>At first, AMG was kind enough to provide me with a rental for the times I was actually on the ground in Vegas. It was a serviceable Ford Focus, and did the job as it were. But spending $2K+ a month to give me wheels didn&#8217;t quite fit their budget, so after my TiÃ«sto tour gig and prior to me running out the lease in Vegas, I had to acquire my own vehicle. A few options presented themselves, most notably of which was the vehicle I now own, the Mercedes E320.</p>

<p>Now, not being a car expert as it were, I had to call on some assistance to evaluate the purchase. So, I called on a friend of mine out there who owned a shop, to help me evaluate the Benz. In not so many words, it turned out to be a gem. It ran stable and was a good performer for the price, and he left it at &#8220;If you don&#8217;t buy it, I will&#8230;&#8221;. So, sold! I was suddenly a Mercedes owner.</p>

<p>However, as it is an older vehicle, I was advised to get it serviced and any minor repairs dealt with. I guess this is where my inherent geekiness kicked in. Whenever I purchase a new device, be it a camera, lens, phone, laptop, hard drive, or whatever, I research the hell out of it. I look for the obvious pros and cons, and also any tweaks, upgrades, hacks, and tricks to getting the most out of the device.</p>

<p>But, I guess I never considered a car as being a &#8220;device&#8221;. Suddenly, this whole new world opened up to me. DTC codes, OBD-II ports, chassis numbers, ECU patches and upgrades, tire ratings, curb weights, bus voltages, optimal ranges for RPMs, fuel efficiency, horsepower, etc. It was like dissecting a computer component but there&#8217;s moving parts and physics to call into account too. I guess I got hooked. And, from a pure tech perspective, it&#8217;s great. I actually enjoy the research and the challenge of keeping the W210 up to spec and beyond.</p>

<p>Sidebar: Mercedes, like other manufacturers, typically assigns chassis numbers to certain classes of vehicles. For example, the W210 chassis encompasses the model years 1998-2002 and specifically the E320, E430, E300 turbodiesel, E55 AMG, and a few other models. Most enthusiasts of the brand refer to their cars by the chassis number in addition to the model number. Total geek thing.</p>

<p>But anyways, I guess my inherent need to break something down into it&#8217;s components and see how it all works comes into play. I found out that the headlamp lenses could be replaced, for example. And yes, the more you know, the more you can save by doing things yourself or getting a good lead on what the mechanic will be doing. Each headlamp lens I had swapped in this morning was $85.00 as opposed to $300.00 for the entire housing if I just went with a dealer.</p>

<p>I also actually plan on getting an OBD-II dongle which interfaces with my iPhone. More stats and numbers to obsess over.</p>

<p>And I guess somewhere along the way I started becoming a &#8220;car guy&#8221;. It&#8217;s a fun diversion.</p>

<p>Now, of course I&#8217;m smart about it. I really only drive when I have to, and I still avail myself of public options when it&#8217;s convenient or safe to do so, hence my retaining of my Easy Card and having a Car 2 Go membership. Keeping those options around (I switched my Easy Card to &#8220;refill when needed&#8221;) doesn&#8217;t cost any money unless you use it, so it&#8217;s nice to have a &#8220;B&#8221; and &#8220;C&#8221; option, and a &#8220;too cheap to ride a cab and am going out for a drink or five&#8221; option too.</p>

<p>So, some of the &#8220;old Pod&#8221; still remains. Go figure.</p>

<p>Like I&#8217;ve stated before. I don&#8217;t really do what I do with the end-goal of money in my sights. Having money is nice, and certainly has it&#8217;s benefits in today&#8217;s society, but I&#8217;ve found along the way that if your driving force is solely the acquisition of it, and the conspicuous consumption of it, it will corrupt. I&#8217;ve seen some really good people turn into <em>raging assholes</em> because of it. Or just plain old douchebags. Pardon my language.</p>

<p>I do what I do because I really love to do it. Photo work, video work, and the occasional web project keep me happy and put food on the table, and allow for a balance in my life to spend with friends and family. I don&#8217;t expect any sort of accolade or reward.</p>

<p>But occasionally they do come in.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I tend to laugh off social networking as a diversion and, at the business level, a potential waste of resources. The most successful businesspeople in the world that I personally know and know of didn&#8217;t build their empires by posting Facebook posts and ads, but they did it pretty much by turning out a good product or service. Yes, you gotta get the word out, but the business will come to you after that initial push.</p>

<p>But, anyways, I was talking about social networking, not business. Oh, by the way, I don&#8217;t have much in the way of business acumen. I can tell you what camera or computer to buy, but beyond that, you&#8217;re on your own.</p>

<p>Social networking, right. Yes, it&#8217;s mostly a diversion and a front for large-scale data mining that would make the KGB envious, but sometimes it does have it&#8217;s moments.</p>

<p>Like tonight. The person in the Facebook chat window above friend-requested me earlier this evening. Now, I didn&#8217;t quite recognize this person off the bat, but we had enough mutual known friends for me to theorize that we had met at some point in the past. So, I figured I would &#8220;clear&#8221; this person and take it from there. If they proved to be a spammer or an unscrupulous promoter, it would take all of five seconds to screen them. Facebook does do things right on occasion.</p>

<p>About a few minutes later, the above message came through. I was out on a run and unfortunately the person was offline by the time I got back, so realtime communication wasn&#8217;t possible. However, at the risk of being sappy, that did make my night. Again, I don&#8217;t expect awards or accolades for my work, but when they come in completely unsolicited, it does make my day.</p>

<p>Thank you kind semi-stranger. You made my night.</p>

<p>OK, back to my scheduled ranting and raving.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/isaacgram.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'Isaac Weekend'" ></p>

<p>I think this past weekend was a good example of what I&#8217;ve heard some people refer to as a &#8220;South Florida Snow Day&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As I alluded to in the last post, Tropical Storm (and potential future hurricane) Isaac popped up on the South Florida cultural radar this past week. The usual cautionary tales ensued, with speculation turning to preparation on Thursday and Friday. Friday, the rain started to show up, with Saturday becoming a complete washout.</p>

<p>By Saturday night though, it appeared Isaac would only be a low-grade tropical storm, and the worst of it was to miss South Florida entirely, and veer through the Keys and out into the Gulf. But, the machinery of closures was already in motion. It definitely reminded me of the snow days growing up&#8230;</p>

<p>I grew up in the Northeast. As such, we had snow days when I was in school. If a storm happened, often the roads would be rendered dangerous, and as we were a walking/drive-your-kids-to-and-from-school district (only the special needs kids got buses), it was considered a liability to have kids out and about going to and from school in the event of a snow emergency. So, early in the morning of the day of the storm, the powers that be over at the school district HQ, would decide to declare a snow day, or not. They sometimes erred on the side of caution, choosing to close the district even if the accumulation wasn&#8217;t that bad. So, there&#8217;d be three inches of snow on the ground (a laughable amount), and school would be closed.</p>

<p>Much like yesterday (Monday) with regards to Isaac. I woke up Monday morning, and was surprised to see the sun was out. However, the day prior, Sunday, was a complete rain event, as they say, and the governments and major businesses had already called off their Monday operations. I guess in the case of government, it&#8217;s hard to recall a shutdown. However, it did rain a lot Monday afternoon, and I think it was a much-needed day off for a lot of people, personally. Though with remote work capabilities and telecommuting, the economy probably didn&#8217;t suffer too much.</p>

<p>I think it was as close to a perfect situation in terms of disruption as you can get though. Enough rain came around to cause government and big business to shut down, but not so much as to engender widespread devastation and chaos. In practical matters, people got time off, and South Florida&#8217;s party machine kicked into action over the weekend. It was &#8220;slow&#8221;, of course, but most bars and nightclubs had enough business to justify staying open. I wonder what that says for society when we&#8217;ll go through hell and high water to get drunk? Probably that we spend too much time at work, personally. But, that&#8217;s another blog rant.</p>

<p>The party machine around was definitely active, with the events I attended at Chalk on South Beach, and of course Space in Downtown Miami, being heavily attended.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/classics-3797.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Space Classics'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/fuji-3505.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Chalk'" ></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been through a few rain events and hurricanes, and despite the threat of damage and destruction, I&#8217;ve always kind of liked the atmosphere at hurricane parties. Plus, nothing beats exiting a venue and realizing, rather dimly, that you probably should get home and see about getting things situated in case the storm really does come. I remember when Hurricane Wilma, the last storm of any significance to come through South Florida directly, came through in October of 2005. I was living on Normandy Isle in the northern part of Miami Beach at the time in a fairly rattletrap (Sorry Su, it&#8217;s true&#8230;but we had fun!) apartment building, and I got around via public transport or taxis. I had shot an event with Sander Kleinenberg at Space earlier, and made my usual late exit from the venue that Sunday morning. Of course, I had heard reports that this pesky storm might just come for us, but didn&#8217;t give it much thought. I had gotten home, checked a few reports, most of which centered on &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s coming for Miami, but at what strength we don&#8217;t know&#8230;&#8221;, and passed out to sleep. I woke up about eight hours later to the sounds of my roommate and his friend stocking up for the storm. Apparently it was close, as we lost power a few hours later. Fortunately we had enough random provisions to get through the next few days, but for a minute it was kind of tense as we had no &#8220;real&#8221; food.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little more responsible nowadays, I think. I have a few gallons of water on hand and a FIVESTAR account with hotels.com. And I keep an eye on my iPhone during potential hurricane periods. If things look ugly, I&#8217;ll prebook a hotel inland and north and get out of town. Might not be the most entertaining course of action, but fortunately I&#8217;m mobile. I can fit everything important to me (gear, data, and some clothes) into my trunk. And if the storm is a non-event, I can come back home.</p>

<p>It might not work for you though. Don&#8217;t blame me if it doesn&#8217;t.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/08/25/cruising-south-florida</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets.jpg" width="960" height="960" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p>Apparently there&#8217;s a hurricane on the way. Or a tropical storm at the most. It&#8217;s the usual subdued panic in South Florida. Yes, I&#8217;m aware that even a tropical storm can cause damage, and it&#8217;s always better to be safe than sorry, but if the news media is to be believed, Armageddon is upon us.</p>

<p>It made for a very low-key Friday night, that&#8217;s for sure. And today is shaping up to be more of the same.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Which is actually OK with me. I like to kick back and relax and do what I want rather than what I need to do. And one of those things is cruising around and shooting the deserted streets at night. In my mind, it&#8217;s similar, in a way, to the scenics and landscapes I&#8217;ve been shooting lately. There&#8217;s definitely an interesting juxtaposition with the works of humanity in the photo, but humanity itself isn&#8217;t present.</p>

<p>And last night made that easy. No one was out, anywhere. I ostensibly drove north on the express lanes in I-95 to try out a new set of tires I put on the W210 earlier in the day. Bridgestone RE970s if anyone is curious. And in the rain at cruising speed, they stuck to the road like glue, even at &#8220;autobahn&#8221; speeds of 130 kph&#8230;around 81 mph or so.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://distilleryimage5.instagram.com/e1e54fdeee6a11e1829522000a1e88aa_7.jpg" title="'I-95 NB Express'" ></p>

<p>Of course I had my gear on me, since I intended on getting off the beaten path and shooting some deserted streets. From Downtown Fort Lauderdale to Washington Avenue on South Beach to Wynwood in Miami, it was a quiet Friday night. There were small bursts of activity here and there, but it was definitely a slow night. Which suited me just fine. I captured some excellent deserted street scenes.</p>

<p>One of the challenges, of course, was keeping my camera dry. I kind of forgot about that. However, I improvised with a plastic bag from my trunk and a musty old t-shirt to wipe away any condensation. And even though I had my trusty Manfrotto tripod with me, I handheld all of my images from the past evening. ISO 3200 and 6400. Don&#8217;t fear the noise.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets-3454.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets-3462.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets-3473.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets-3476.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p>Driving Washington Avenue was fun. I drove from 5th Street to Lincoln, and marveled at all the shuttered nightclub spaces. It&#8217;s really the subject of another rant, but it&#8217;s amazing to see the huge seasonal turnover in nightclubs on the Beach. You think these guys would realize there&#8217;s only three big players in town and only so many people to go around.</p>

<p>Anyways, it was a successful street scene shooting session. This wasn&#8217;t commercially motivated, it was all &#8220;just for me&#8221;. I think in the quest to stay solvent, a lot of photographers forget to go out and shoot what they want in addition to what they need to shoot. Though a fortunate few can shoot what they want and it fills their needs quite nicely. Regardless, shooting what you want is definitely recommended. It&#8217;s relaxing if anything. Strip your kit down to what you need (again, don&#8217;t fear the noise), get out there, and press the shutter button.</p>

<p>Be safe out there, South Florida.</p>

    <link href="http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/08/22/how-it-was/"/>
    <updated>2012-08-22T12:24:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/08/22/how-it-was</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lynx.png" width="960" height="588" title="'Lynx'" ></p>

<p>Telnet, Gopher, Lynx.</p>

<p>This is how was way back when. The Web was in it&#8217;s infancy, and the Internet was still largely the province of academia, the government, and disinterested large corporations.</p>

<p>And it was great.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Now, I&#8217;m not going to turn this into a rant of how awesome things were back in the day, even though they were. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the advancements in the technology of the internet have been amazing over the past twenty years. The sum of human knowledge can be accessed from a small device that fits in my pocket, regardless of whether I am at home, or 30,000 feet above the midwestern United States. I can transmit and receive photos, audio, and video in realtime from anywhere in the world. Through social networks, I can keep in touch with my friends easily, and even the technophobic can post media of their life events, easily. It&#8217;s amazing if you think about it.</p>

<p>However, along the way, I think we&#8217;ve lost something. The internet used to have more of a community spirit to it. During the initial move from academia and big business providing access, to the period of time when the hometown ISP reigned supreme, there was an undeniable pioneer spirit online. People were developing technologies and doing things not just for the sake of a payout, but for the betterment of the community as a whole. You could post up a page of your thoughts and ideas and content, and not have to worry about monetizing it or gathering followers on someone else&#8217;s social network. You ran &#8220;your thing&#8221; from top to bottom, and ideas and advice were just an email or forum posting away if you didn&#8217;t know how to do it. Trade and barter were strongly encouraged. You would help someone figure out how to post an inline image on their website, and they in turn would help you post up an audio file on yours.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ns10.jpg" width="960" height="720" title="'NS'" ></p>

<p>It was all quite community-oriented, but we also knew that we needed to make a few bucks to put food on the table and that sort of thing. But the overriding spirit was very &#8216;community&#8217;, but not to the point of being in someone&#8217;s business 24/7. You could ask for help if you needed it, but in general if you wanted to be left alone, you were.</p>

<p>I think they called it &#8216;common courtesy&#8217; or manners. I think along the way since then, we&#8217;ve lost that. I&#8217;m not talking about the trolls really. Trolls have been with us since the early days, even before Goa Tse and rotten.com. Don&#8217;t google those if you can help it. But, people generally kept out of your business, and didn&#8217;t spam or otherwise harass you.</p>

<p>A good example happened to me this morning. I had a meeting with a friend of mine at his office in Downtown. When I arrived, he was madly typing away on his laptop, shaming in public as it were, one of his subordinates for spamming his Facebook wall. For reference, my friend is a marketing head for a major nightlife concern. What had happened was several of his promoters had posted promotions repeatedly on his wall, without regards for placement or realizing that there really was no need to do so, since he was the one who ordered the promoters to get to work. But, in my mind, it represented the long-term decline of common courtesy on the internet. Now, everyone&#8217;s free to speak their mind. This is one of the hallmarks of the internet, you can speak your mind and reach millions with one gesture. However, with that power has come a simply staggering amount of noise. And most of that is simple discourtesy, greed, and hubris.</p>

<p>Everyone is free to make a buck. That&#8217;s fine. I like to have some money in the bank myself. However, acquiring money at the expense of the ethos of the modern internet doesn&#8217;t sit well with me. You can get your message out without resorting to underhanded spam tactics and outright data theft. Sadly, in nightlife and entertainment, people think nothing of hijacking other&#8217;s contacts and private data, all in the name of making one more dollar. Promoters think nothing of co-opting your personal information, just to make you one more bit in their marketing database. It&#8217;s why my current business cards only have my name and website on them. From there you have to jump through a few hoops to get ahold of me. My work speaks for itself, and I&#8217;d like to think that if you are really interested in working together, you will go through an extra two minutes of thinking to get ahold of me.</p>

<p>But, most people don&#8217;t think this way. In the pursuit of the almighty dollar, the little things have been lost. The internet isn&#8217;t a liberated medium of free expression anymore. It&#8217;s been co-opted into a rapidly-centralizing mishmash of meaningless social media metrics (better get those likes, kids, before your Klout score slips one-half of a point and you are no longer relevant!), intrusive advertising, and infestations of the lowest common denominator. In other words, it&#8217;s much like television, except you have the illusion of being able to talk back.</p>

<p>Listen, I know there&#8217;s controls and filters and so forth. I use them extensively. However, with the breakdown of respect and courtesy online, people strike a pose to get through those filters, then it&#8217;s a veritable spam rodeo.</p>

<p>I know at the end of the day, we&#8217;re not going to return to the glory days of yore. They are gone, I can accept that. I also accept that two-thirds of the internet is now populated by spammers, snake-oil salesmen, and egocentric social media addicts. It&#8217;s kind of why I established this little platform of mine. From top-to-bottom, from source to syndication, this is all under my control. Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Foursquare have no control over this platform unless I give it to them.</p>

<p>At the end of the day though, I hope there is some shred of decency left in us all, and we can kind of steer ourselves to a happy medium, where people can converse and share and conduct business, all without being unreasonably intrusive upon each other.</p>

<p>And yes, I know the irony is that I&#8217;m going to share this post on Facebook. I never said social networking was useless&#8230;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ferrer-2724.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'I can seeeeee you!'" ></p>

<p>Local photojournalist and all-around good guy <a href="http://www.pixiq.com/contributors/248">Carlos Miller</a> got me thinking recently after the last <a href="http://www.pixiq.com/article/four-cop-cars-get-called-on-us">photo protest</a> he staged in front of the Miami Herald building.</p>

<p>A lot of people have a fear of photography. And I really can&#8217;t figure out why. Sure, for some people I can see it. They&#8217;re doing something they probably shouldn&#8217;t be, and there&#8217;s scads of photographic recording devices around them, which may or may not be recording their actions. I encounter it out in the clubs from time to time. I like to shoot wide, as you can see above, and I may inadvertently capture someone doing something (or someone, ba-dum-ching&#8230;) they shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>

<p>It certainly isn&#8217;t deliberate on my part though. Whatever transgressions you may be committing, that&#8217;s your problem and not mine. I&#8217;m not out to ruin your life, since it appears that you&#8217;re quite capable of doing that on your own. And no, I won&#8217;t delete it. You are a noisy red smear at the bottom of the frame. And you probably shouldn&#8217;t be cheating on your pretty wife in front of thousands of people and about that many cameras.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>But, that&#8217;s just with crackheads in nightclubs, which, fortunately, form a small minority of our population.</p>

<p>The real head-scratcher is the people who get worked up over photography in public places. If you can see it from a public location, you can shoot it, it&#8217;s that simple. I don&#8217;t buy the national security bit or anything of that nature. If I take a photo of the refinery near Fort Lauderdale airport, the photo, other than a creative piece, tells me nothing. It&#8217;s a collection of pipes. It won&#8217;t aid a terrorist in planning to blow it up. And, if a terrorist wants to blow up the refinery, a photo isn&#8217;t going to hinder or help him or her too much. It&#8217;s not like in the movies where they can deduce where the 2-meter wide exhaust vent is from a cell phone photo.</p>

<p>Even more puzzling are the ordinary citizens who bring it upon themselves to get worked up over photos in public places. The photo protest I mentioned is a perfect example. In a nutshell, the ordinary citizen was a security guard, who took it upon himself to misquote the law, leading to the situation described in Carlos&#8217; blog entry. Now, a few words on that.</p>

<p>A security guard is an ordinary citizen. He doesn&#8217;t have police powers. As a matter of fact, he&#8217;s even more restricted from certain actions in the course of his job than an ordinary citizen is. The industry&#8217;s slogan is &#8220;Observe and Report&#8221;. That&#8217;s about all they can do. Plus, from a pragmatic perspective, the pay scale isn&#8217;t high enough to justify more than that. If I was working the front desk at the Herald, I&#8217;d either ignore it and get back to my Youtube viewing, or just kick it upstairs and let the bureaucrats in facilities deal with it. Yes, I&#8217;m being totally lazy and &#8220;not dedicated&#8221;, but for $12/hr and no benefits, you&#8217;re only going to get so much out of me. I&#8217;d rather spend my effort on something more meaningful, ya know?</p>

<p>Getting worked up about people shooting photos in public places is a complete waste of one&#8217;s energy. There&#8217;s so much more out there to expend effort on. Plus, if you think about it, the camera is ubiquitous now. If something is not recorded, that is an unusual set of circumstances indeed. In a society such as ours, there&#8217;s at least one camera recording the scene at all times in any given public location. The ethics of such ubiquitous recording? Well, that&#8217;s another debate entirely.</p>

<p>But such recording shouldn&#8217;t be feared. If you don&#8217;t want it recorded, don&#8217;t put it in a public location.</p>

<p>Looks like Car 2 Go heard the noise I was making&#8230;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t do advertorial or paid postings, it defeats the purpose of this blog, in my mind. Anything I talk about or endorse here is based on personal experience and not because someone paid me off. If I think something is useful or quality, I&#8217;ll post about it here. <a href="http://miami.car2go.com/">Car 2 Go</a> is definitely a great service and worth what I pay for it. Keep up the good work guys.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been through the advertorial wringer before. It&#8217;s fun for a few minutes while you get paid, but after awhile, if you are posing as a legitimate news source, it does get tiring after awhile if you have any sort of humanity.</p>

<p>The sad thing is, advertisers and companies have come to expect advertorial as a standard practice these days. I&#8217;ve been around plenty of people and corporations when the question of the media and coverage for their product/brand/event comes up, and a notable amount of the discussion does center on the advertorial side of things. What&#8217;s even worse, is when you see what appear to be respectable news outlets going along for the advertorial ride.</p>

<p>Listen, as far as pure journalism goes, it&#8217;s a tough world out there now. Ad sales have dried up, and obviously it costs money to operate and maintain a decent news outlet. However, there are ways to cut costs and still maintain standards of ethical and journalistic integrity. A lot of &#8220;fat&#8221; can be cut on the infrastructure side of things, for example. This very blog is an example. While I don&#8217;t have it configured for true high-availability, I know I could scale it up as such where having this blog as an HA app wouldn&#8217;t break the bank. A little knowledge goes a long way.</p>

<p>I think, at the end of the day, journalists and news organizations should embrace being a bit multi-talented, enabling them to continue delivering unbiased news, without having to resort to deceptive advertorial processes.</p>

<p>And yes, I know the guilty parties in the advertorial game. Let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s not too surprising. I&#8217;ll keep my own counsel for now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://seenightlife.com/photos/15591/original_mixreunion-chilloutroom-mix.jpg" width="640" height="427" title="'The Mix'" ></p>

<p>I was doing a little digging today, and happened upon this little gem from when I was just getting started in my club shooting days.</p>

<p>Shot on film at South Beach&#8217;s then-notorious afterhours, called The Mix, I took it for a <em>class project</em> at UM no less.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I shot this frame on a roll of store-bought Fujicolor Xperia 400 film for my Intro to Color Photography and Printmaking (ART 3xx?) at UM in late 1999. We had to develop our own film, and then print it out on a very disagreeable Kreonite RA4 paper processor.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://www.dphoto.us/classifieds/data/5/6103promate1-large.jpg" width="672" height="504" title="'Kreonite'" ></p>

<p>Often offline, or out of service entirely, the printer, similar to the above, was a hotly-contested piece of hardware over in the photo lab at UM. The irony being of course the amount of money it cost to go to UM, and we were saddled with a creaky processor.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure nowadays, time has improved the department somewhat (sidebar, if anyone from the UM photo department reads this, I&#8217;d love to do a guest spot!), and the learning path is almost entirely digital.</p>

<p>Which begs the question, in the photo world, is it possible to effectively learn the fundamentals when you can immediately see the results?</p>

<p>In the real world, there are plenty of shooters out there who make a living of it, and have never touched film or learned the formalities. They shoot via the Golden BB method, hoping that if they spray enough projectiles in the air, one will hit the target. Personally, it seems like a waste, even in the digital realm. Plus I feel you don&#8217;t really learn if you depend on getting that one lucky photo in a session. I would much rather analyze the situation, set up accordingly, and push the shutter button once. I guess, in military terms, I&#8217;d be a sniper. One shot, one kill. I&#8217;m not in a hurry.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://seenightlife.com/photos/2008/original_dannyhowells001.jpg" width="640" height="427" title="'Danny Howells at Space'" ></p>

<p>Photos like the above weren&#8217;t composed with the Golden BB method. You only had a finite amount of frames to work with, and none could be deleted and reused. Each shot had to count, for the most part.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a more efficient and elegant workflow anyhow. Each image counts, rather than just one throwaway amongst many.</p>

<p>The benefits of digital technology on photography have been enormous, with digital sensors objectively outperforming film in almost all aspects. However, along the way, certain techniques and refinements have been lost. The Golden BB method is sadly prevalent, unfortunately.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://gallery.photo.net/photo/1232337-md.jpg" width="766" height="504" title="'Miami 2000'" ></p>

<p>The above is one of my favorite images that I&#8217;ve taken. The gear used consisted of a $200 Pentax ZX-5n film SLR, a roll of $8 Fuji 400 film I bought in a drugstore, and an $80 chunk of Sigma glass with no special features other than a macro function. It shows the Metromover tracks near the original location of Club Space, looking south towards Brickell. This was prior to the AA Arena, the &#8220;Biscayne Wall&#8221; of condos such as Ten Museum Park, 900 Biscayne, The Everglades, and so on, as well as more recent additions like The Marquis. Almost a Miami of old at this point.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>However, I managed to capture the subtle tones of the sunrise and the remnants of the evening mixed with the street and track lighting. Kind of an early attempt at my current fascination with scenics, I guess.</p>

<p>Without my description, most would have guessed I captured this with a decent digital SLR, or if they had an eye for Miami and the time depicted, a fairly top-of-the-range film body and lens. The reality is, I grabbed this frame with less than $300 worth of equipment. On film. Most club photographers have never touched film. I still have to take action on this, but one of these weekends, I&#8217;m going to shoot a few rolls of film at Space for the hell of it.</p>

<p>A lot of photographers, professional and otherwise, are victims of gear lust. Sure, I am too, but since I got started, I always tried to hold true to the ethic of &#8220;The best camera is the one you have on you&#8221;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s akin to what is taught in military academies around the country, &#8220;You go to war with the army you have, not the one you want&#8221;. You are basically limited by your situation and your budget. Budget, obviously, because not every working professional can justify or afford a 1-series Canon body or a Nikon D4. And situationally, since it isn&#8217;t always practical to carry around a large digital SLR and several lenses everywhere you go.</p>

<p>For the longest time, I shot with crop-frame mid-range digital SLRs. My work level and situation made stepping up to a full-frame body like the 5D MK II an unrealistic proposition. Maybe not so unrealistic, but more of me being cautious. My existing camera bodies generated superb images in my hands, and there was no pressing need to upgrade. I only finally upgraded to the 5D MK II when it made sense for me to do so, since several clients were asking for video work, and the 5D MK II made the most sense for my shooting style. And even then, the 5D MK II was a three year-old piece of hardware, which still generated superb images in the hands of an experienced shooter.</p>

<p>But regardless, due to the situation I was in at the time, I lacked independent transport. I took the bus everywhere. And I bought my SLR kit with me, out of necessity, since I&#8217;d often be on my way to or from a shoot. Even if I wasn&#8217;t specifically shooting something, I always feared I&#8217;d get a call-up to shoot something right away, and my gear would be several bus rides or an expensive cab journey away, if I didn&#8217;t have it on me. Very cumbersome way of conducting business. Obviously when I acquired my own independent transport, this became less of a problem as I could stow my gear in my trunk (a scary proposition in some areas), or keep it at home, but still be able to buzz back to base and snag it if the need arose.</p>

<p>However, the news or &#8220;that specific situation&#8221; doesn&#8217;t always wait for me to rocket down I-95 at 100 MPH and skid over to my apartment to pick up my gear. So, the camera I may have on me at that moment is my iPhone 4s. The cameras inside phones have come a long way. The 4s is still, as of this writing, the undisputed champ in my mind, especially when coupled with decent photo apps from the App Store. One of my favorites is <a href="http://www.awesomize.com/"> Camera Awesome</a>. Developed by Smugmug, Camera Awesome has an ingenious system for focusing, exposure, as well as a basic suite of post-production tools, enabling you to crank out an acceptable JPEG in a hurry if the need arises. It also integrates with Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and standard email.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ca.png" width="640" height="960" title="'Camera Awesome'" ></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve cranked out plenty of what I consider decent images using this little app. Several more exist, such as Hipstamatic and so forth, but Camera Awesome seems to be more geared towards those with a modicum of photo knowledge.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I actually don&#8217;t freak out as much when I leave my MK II behind, like if I am going out to a purely social occasion somewhere and it&#8217;s impractical or impolite to be carrying a giant bag of gear around, and maybe not the best idea in the world to leave it in the trunk of your vehicle. Since, I know I have my iPhone with a decent app close at hand, and know how to work with and around it&#8217;s limitations. I won&#8217;t be generating prize-winning work anytime soon with my iPhone, but I&#8217;m actually pretty impressed with the results. I work with the camera I have on me when the situation arises, I don&#8217;t muck about wishing I bought my full-size rig. Though that being said, 95 percent of the time I do have my equipment within ten feet of me. It&#8217;s the 5 percent of the rest of the time I&#8217;ve learned to calm down about and not worry about it. I know I can pop off a decent iPhone photo at any time if the situation demands it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m of course not suggesting everyone ditch their SLRs for iPhones, but at the same time, don&#8217;t be susceptible to gear lust. Sometimes you just need to make do with what you have. And actually, when you work with what you have, a lot of the time, the end results will surprise you.</p>

<p>FYI, if anyone is interested in seeing my attempts at iPhone photography, check out my Instacanvas gallery (prints of my Instagrams) at <a href="http://instacanv.as/pod_gram">instacanv.as/pod_gram</a>. It&#8217;s cheap!</p>

<p>I got into a discussion just now over on <a href="http://forum.talknightlife.com/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=19857">Talk Nightlife</a> with James, founder of <a href="http://soulofmiami.org/">Soul of Miami</a> about some of the trials and tribulations of the photographers and photo editors in the Olympics. I linked on over to a <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2012/08/10/click-edit-crop-or-drop/">blog post on Reuters</a> about the workflow of their on-site photo team. James&#8217; comment was that it was fascinating, but essentially <strong>&#8220;It really does not seem like they could possibly be getting paid enough for that.&#8221;</strong></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>
Sadly, that is the truth. However, most of us whom are into the photo and video industries aren&#8217;t into it for a big payday. Sure, income is nice, but at the end of the day, a photo career is a lot of hard work, and is often times frustrating, and the income rarely is there.</p>

<p>Sure, every guy and girl behind the lens has fantasies of one day making that &#8216;big score&#8217;, and not having to work again, but in most cases, that never happens. They might make what would be equivalent to mid-to-high five figures on average per year, but most of that money gets eaten up in taxes, reinvesting in the business, and general expenses associated with running said business. It&#8217;s why if you see a photographer with a bunch of fancy non-photo-related toys, chances are that he or she probably has a second source of money, whether it&#8217;s a &#8220;real job&#8221;, another business that pays real money, or comes from money and happens to have a &#8220;hobby&#8221;. And yes, there&#8217;s always the slight chance that they scored and are living quite well off of their photo incomes.</p>

<p>Since the digital revolution, the intrinsic monetary value of photography has gone down enormously. A lot of shooters struggle to stay afloat and often have to make concessions and do other things to make ends meet. I&#8217;m a perfect example. I earn money from photography and video, but I have to tinker with websites and take on odd tasks related to the web to make ends meet. I&#8217;m very frugal but things still cost money. Also, it is a bit more costly to obtain basic health insurance on your own, than it is if you are part of a standard corporate entity.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually why I&#8217;ve come around a bit on the whole government-provided healthcare issue actually. I&#8217;m for small government, but I do think one of the duties of the government is to take care of it&#8217;s taxpayers. I think that if we&#8217;re taken care of on a basic level by state health insurance, that would actually free us, as a people, up to take more risks in business and our personal lives. I know a lot of people with big ideas and dreams, who don&#8217;t want to leave their corporate gigs, because said gigs provide the benefit of health insurance. And, obviously those corporate gigs demand a fair share of one&#8217;s time and energy. But the healthcare rant is another post entirely. Hey, it&#8217;s my blog, I don&#8217;t have to necessarily adhere to standard editorial guidelines.</p>

<p>But anyways, society as a whole has come to devalue the work of photographers. Now, at no point has a photography career ever been a sure path to untold riches or success. Whether the workflow was analog or digital, it&#8217;s always been the rare person who made their millions off of photography. And if they did make their millions off of it, chances are they are dead or pretty close to it, and the value of their work has increased by virtue of that. Suffice to say, the quickest way to increase the value of your photography is to die, preferably in a dramatic fashion.</p>

<p>All jokes aside though, the value, and the respect of the art has been diminished somewhat over the past decade. And it has been a two-pronged assault, from without, and from within. From without, it&#8217;s been clients seeking the cheap way out. Even the most professional organizations expect to be able to pay only a pittance for work. A campaign that might cost thousands on the part of the photographer to execute, the client might only be willing to pay a few hundred dollars for. Of course everyone wants to spend as little as possible, but there is a point where the client base does need to remember that &#8216;they get what they pay for&#8217;. You only pay a few hundred dollars, well, that is about all the work you will get. Someone recently offered me $50 and a bucket of booze to shoot a party. I blew them off, it wasn&#8217;t even worth a response. Everyone knows I like to have a drink or two, but I won&#8217;t work for that sort of thing. I have bills to pay. And $50 would not cover my own nightly expenses, as the gig was on South Beach (no Car2Go), and of course my time in post and editing.
If you want to pay me $50, I&#8217;d expect a chauffeured ride to and from the venue, and I&#8217;ll probably take three photos, steal your girlfriend, and not bother delivering the edit (1 photo) until sometime in 2025.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s just the problem from without. The problem from within is almost as bad. The digital revolution has put quality imaging tools into the hands of all. For $400 or less (say, a used Drebel kit), one can obtain a quality digital SLR with a basic lens. Under decent lighting conditions, this kit can objectively shoot great images, even in the hands of an amateur. And said images could conceivably be used for commercial purposes with the right editing and post production. So, now, businesses can hire &#8220;some guy they know&#8221;, or &#8220;do it in-house&#8221; (though there&#8217;s nothing wrong with an staff shooter in some instances, as long as rights and releases are fair), and attempt to save a buck or two, and have &#8220;some guy they know&#8221; fix any of the problems later, or leave the fixing to some beleaguered designer at a graphic design firm somewhere. Sidebar: graphic designers hate that.</p>

<p>When confronted, the businesses and the shooters themselves will often plead ignorance, or claim that &#8220;this is the way things are now, deal with it&#8221;.
Understandably, the dynamics of the digital economy have changed things, but photographers and other visual professionals do need to have an income to survive and keep providing these services to clients. If all photography was cheap and/or free, eventually there would be no photographers to generate the images clients require and need. And computer rendering of realistic scenes is far more expensive (to do right) than booking the services of a photographer, so don&#8217;t try to get me there!</p>

<p>What&#8217;s even worse is the lack of understanding of licensing and rights, as well. Very few businesses understand this. They treat all photographic work for them as work-for-hire, with unlimited use. To them, once the photo is taken, it is theirs. It doesn&#8217;t work that way. Licensing and sale is one of the only ways a photographer can stand a chance of making a reasonable living nowadays, especially in the situations I&#8217;ve described above. And very few photographers understand it as well as they should. It took me awhile to get a handle on it, but once one understands the ins and outs of it, it&#8217;s easy to figure out.
In this case, Google is your friend. Search for &#8220;editorial photography rate guidelines&#8221; and go from there. I&#8217;m not being lazy, there is just a huge amount of information on pricing your work accordingly. FYI, it&#8217;s why a decent-sized print of mine will run you a few hundred dollars or more at <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">my Fine Art America</a> page.</p>

<p>Again, we&#8217;re in this because we love to do it, not because we&#8217;re seeking a route to glorious riches and untold glory. All anyone behind the lens asks for is just compensation to cover the costs of doing business, and enjoy life while we&#8217;re at it. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s many photographers out there whom are greedy and driven by dollar signs. Even we like to put the camera down sometimes and take a little vacation somewhere. With a smaller camera of course, we might see something interesting along the way.</p>
