<p>I venture outside of the world of nightlife in my shooting when possible. While challenging as it is to shoot in that sort of environment &#8220;my way&#8221;, even more of a challenge is to take something rather common, the landscape photograph, and put my own spin on it.</p>

<p>What I like to find is a mix of the works of humans with the works of nature. So, on a drive to Key West one evening, I had it in my mind to try to capture a sunset off of one of the islands on the way down to Key West.</p>

<p></p>

<p>One of the frustrations of that, is that it isn&#8217;t always possible to get that ideal angle, simply due to the traffic situation on the way down. Unless you plan way in advance (which I should have), you have to deal with the vagaries of only having one main road the entire way. Thus you can find yourself stuck behind some slow-movers, just as that magic hour hits.</p>

<p>I was gauging an ideal destination based on an earlier trip I had made a few weeks prior. I didn&#8217;t make it all the way down to Key West, but I had dropped a few pins on my iPhone&#8217;s map utility, to mark a few places. The one I had in mind was close, but traffic wasn&#8217;t cooperating. So, when the ideal time hit, I took a gamble and pulled over next to this bridge.</p>

<p>The wind was whipping about like crazy, to the point where I had to fight to stabilize both myself and my camera, despite a heavy-duty Manfrotto tripod. Eventually, I settled into the scene, and ended up composing the above. Much like an expert sniper, I knew I &#8220;had it&#8221; even before the RAW data worked it&#8217;s way through my MK II&#8217;s processors and appeared on the screen. Initially a little underexposed to preserve the sky detail (you can always adjust your exposure upwards later, it&#8217;s much harder to adjust downwards and bring out detail, even in RAW), I could still see the end result in my head, which is represented above.</p>

<p>While I&#8217;m fairly new to landscape photography, I can definitely appreciate the skill it takes to get the image, both from a technical and a logistical perspective. Preparation helps, but sometimes you just have to be ready for the moment to hit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be posting more images in this theme as time goes on, both from my back catalog, and new works as I produce them.</p>

<p>And now a word from our sponsor&#8230;me.</p>

<p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/46475090">GoPro Test</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/dvdigital">Dan V</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t really interested in it as a club tool, though I could see it being useful as a B-camera for some in-the-booth shots. Where I found the most thrill though, was mounting it to the bumper of my car, and driving around Miami. In the video above, you can see some of the results. I&#8217;m not the sharpest editor yet, but the footage speaks for itself, I think. The GoPro is great for what it costs, and will be even better when they roll the new &#8220;ProTune&#8221; firmware any day now and really pump the bitrate.</p>

<p>And yes, this is a blatant excuse to see if Vimeo embedding works.</p>

<p>A lot of people ask me why I shoot like I do, when it comes to nightlife and concerts. Well, there&#8217;s many reasons.</p>


<p>Nowadays, with the ubiquity of the &#8216;nightlife photographer&#8217;, or &#8216;the guy with the blog&#8217; (yes, I&#8217;m well aware that I&#8217;m writing this on a blog platform), one has to strive to differentiate themselves in order to be unique, stand out, and get work. Even if your end goal isn&#8217;t necessarily financially-oriented (and it shouldn&#8217;t be, you aren&#8217;t going to get rich shooting concerts and clubs, it&#8217;s something you have to like to do), your job or vision is easier to pull off if you can develop a coherent style to call your own.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&#8217;ve been working in clubs for about fifteen years now. I started by helping my friend John, now the owner of <a href="http://alchemyavcs.com/">Alchemy Audio Visual Systems</a> with lugging around his nascent rig of EAW speaker cabinets and Crown amplifiers, and doing double duty as his light tech. We provided reinforcement for local punk bands and some DJ shows as well. I was also majoring in motion picture production and fine art photography at the <a href="http://miami.edu/">University of Miami</a>, and working for their IT department as well.</p>

<p>Anyways, I managed to work my nighttime activities into legitimate coursework for my photography classes. I would shoot some of the bands and our lighting setups, when time permitted. Early on, one of the biggest &#8220;rules&#8221; of most venues, if they were cool with me shooting at all, was that flash photography was frowned upon or genuinely prohibited around the performers of the evening. Totally understandable, for two reasons. First off, if you are DJing or playing an instrument, a flash blowing off in your field of vision can be distracting, or even dangerous, if you are the sort of performer who tends to be very dynamic. Also, and this forms the basis of my style, the performers are usually well-lit, or can be at request.</p>

<p>Basically, there&#8217;s a lot of light around if you know how to use it. Nightclubs and concert halls are generally regarded as being dark and dingy, but there is a lot of light within them. LED screens, flat panel displays, swirling intelligent lights, the glow from POS terminals, even candlelight. It can all be used to pull off an effective photo, while not having to resort to using flash photography. Now, there is nothing inherently wrong with flash photography. Used properly, it can provide a wonderful balance to a scene. Used improperly, the results can be substandard, and the act of taking the photo itself can be distracting. One of the keys to successful concert and nightclub photography in my mind is to blend in with the scenery. People tend to be themselves if they think you are one of the crowd, and not some guy with an SLR looking for attention, free entry, and cheap laughs. We all know that guy, he&#8217;s not nice.</p>

<p>Of course, working with the light that is there presents some challenges. Invariably you are operating at a very shallow depth-of-field, a slow shutter speed, a high ISO, or all three. I won&#8217;t get into it in this post, but all three can be compensated for, especially high ISO. High ISO is the easiest to compensate for, actually. Flat out accept the noise. It&#8217;s there, use it and move on. ISO 6400 on a modern DSLR is actually more usable than ISO 1600 on a roll of Fujicolor from the 1990s, even without noise reduction.</p>

<p>So basically, my style is the result of the environment I generally shoot in, and my ethos of blending in with the crowd rather than being the focus of it.

<p>Use the light that&#8217;s there, you might surprise yourself.</p>

<p>(Oh, and this is only a test - I&#8217;ll add photos in a bit)</p>
