<p>For the past few months, a blog called <a href="http://edmsnob.com/">EDM Snob</a> was shaking up the dance music world. Written by an anonymous writer, the blog aired the controversies and the dirty laundry of the scam known as the modern dance music scene. It reminded me of TNL, but in blog form.</p>

<p>Today, the writer decided to reveal his real name and location.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Long suspected to be someone 'in the know', the EDM Snob turned out to be one Albert Berdellans, a graduate student living in Miami, with no formal industry involvement whatsoever.</p>

<p>Albert decided to reveal himself after he found out that people suspected of being him were getting into trouble with their employers, up to the point of losing their jobs, even. That took a lot of courage on his part. Well done, Albert. However, it does reveal a few sad facts, some of which Albert noted in his farewell post. The first one, in my mind, is the most telling:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Up until this point, EDM media had been full of what a fellow writer in an email exchange called “breathless boosterism.” In other words, people were only writing positive things about EDM. That’s great, but nothing in this world is perfect. You have to tell the whole story.</p><footer><strong>Albert Berdellans</strong> <cite><a href='http://edmsnob.com/the-end-of-edmsnob/'>The End of EDM Snob</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>This is reminiscent of my post from a week or so ago, <a href="http://www.dan-vidal.com/blog/2012/09/10/the-free-flow-of-opinion/">The Free Flow Of Opinion</a>. He saw the need for the real story to get out, and provided a channel for it. And yes, the modern commercial dance music world is wholly dependent on advertorial. When your entire premise is making overpaid stars out of guys who play back prerecorded sounds in a set pattern, it's easy for anyone with a modicum of knowledge to see that it's a complete scam.</p>

<p>The sad part comes in on how the dance music world reacted to these stories getting out. In their quest to keep the public from seeing the old man behind the curtain, the industry started making examples out of people suspected to be the EDM Snob, or at least feeding him information. As Albert pointed out:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>here have been times over the last few months where people within the industry have been accused of being me. Sometimes there has even been circumstantial evidence that connects them with something I wrote. In some cases, this has cost people their jobs or seriously damaged their careers. I simply cannot continue to stand by and allow other people to be blamed and suffer for the things I write. No one deserves that.</p><footer><strong>Albert Berdellans</strong> <cite><a href='http://edmsnob.com/the-end-of-edmsnob/'>The End of EDM Snob</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Frankly, that's really what stuck with me. The bits and pieces he was revealing, while somewhat controversial, weren't really that damaging. DJs are still getting booked for $100,000 performances. Clubs still fill up on any given night of the week. However, greed and ego overruled everyone's good sense and led to a disappointing backlash from the industry.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this story has led me to wonder about the free flow of information. Is it possible, not just in dance music, but in the world in general, to run a media source dedicated to exposing what really goes on in a given area, without compromising journalistic ethics, or being forced to shut down? The dance music industry couldn't figure out whom Albert was, so they started chopping the heads of suspected informants, hoping to ferret out his identity. I would do the same, since yes, no one deserves that. Especially over something petty like tour schedules and the backstage riders of guys pressing play on CD decks.</p>

<p>Though, at a practical level, it's just dance music and nightlife. The world will move on with or without the Snob. However, it does reinforce my faith in the self-sustaining nature of the forum concept. At TNL we don't out the personal details of members unless they want us to. And, I think we've managed to hammer home with the venues, DJs, and agents that it is user-driven, so going after us is pointless. I learned this lesson in the CJ days oddly enough. This was just after our acquisition, and prior to the days when Track decided to turn the site into pure advertorial. What the circumstances were was that the notorious (now thankfully defunct) venue, Nocturnal, in Downtown Miami, had the first of many run-ins with unpaid creditors and was subject to a law enforcement-backed collection action, which basically means that the repo men roll up with a cop in tow to do their collections work. So, on the night of the collection action, an anonymous source had sent a forum user some grainy cellphone photos of the trucks and police cruiser in front of the venue. I was home at the moment so I posted a story on the front page, in the sense that it was a breaking news item, and also as an experiment in "realtime" blogging (this was 2006...) through our then-new Movable Type blog engine. The story made the rounds over the weekend, until Monday, when I received a threatening call from an attorney whom represented Nocturnal. A little spooked, I pulled the story. A few minutes later, Nick called me on the carpet, not to ask why I had posted it, but why I had taken it down. The essence was that since it was a news item, and it took place in public (the trucks were on a public street and since PD was involved it was public record), it could stay, and the club didn't have a legal leg to stand on. The club played on my then-ignorance of the law, and I pulled the article. Of course, within a few minutes, I reposted it, and ignored all subsequent phone calls from the attorney. It never went further than that, but if it had, any judge would have thrown out the case before it reached trial.</p>

<p>The moral of that tale is that a knowledge of the law is your best friend as a blogger and/or a journalist. While I understand why Albert decided to cease publication of his blog, had he chosen to take it further, he could have had an airtight legal defense, backed in part by the US Constitution. However, it's hard to take this tactic when people's livelihoods and lives are at stake. The dance music community is very tight, and if you lose a gig under bad circumstances in one firm, there is a very real possibility of being blacklisted throughout the industry.</p>

<p>The industry definitely did not fight fair with Albert on this one. They knew they had no legal recourse against him, so they went for the underhanded tactic of sacrificing people's careers, to force him to have an attack of conscience and cease publication. Again, I would have done the same. I applaud Albert though for stating this. By doing so, he went out with a bang, and gave the modern dance music industry a much-deserved punch in the mouth. I guess if you are going to go, go with style. Cheers to that, Albert. By the way, you are more than welcome to post on <a href="http://talknightlife.com/">TNL</a>.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>"The music business is a cruel and shallow money trench, a long plastic hallway where thieves and pimps run free, and good men die like dogs. There's also a negative side."</p><footer><strong>Mistakenly attributed to Hunter S Thompson</strong> <cite><a href='http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/dubiousquotes/a/hunter_thompson.htm'>HST Misquote</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>HST really didn't say that, but I think it applies to today's dance music industry. It's sad.</p>

<p>I think I'll put on some old vinyl tonight, and remember when it was just about playing good music and having a great night out.</p>

<p>Like a lot of tourist areas, Miami has a high and low season. Typically, ours high season goes from late September until late April. Simply because of the weather.</p>

<p>Though in recent years there's been less of a difference, due to economic factors. The high season isn't as "high" as it used to be, and people will brave the torrid heat and humidity during the summer to save on hotel rates and flight costs.</p>

<p>But still, the fall season is almost here. Warm, but not torrid days, and cool breezy nights will be the norm. It's the time of the year which makes living in the Miami area worthwhile.</p>

<p>Already you can see the change. This past weekend saw temperatures in the mid-80s (upper 20s for you guys who use Celsius), with a noticeable decrease in humidity. The biggest indicator is I don't have to wait as long for the a/c unit in the 210 to bring things down to a reasonable level. I could crank it, sure, but oddly enough Mercedes says that "it really doesn't speed things up too much". And I'll side with the engineers on this one. The 210 is my baby of sorts.</p>

<p>And the excitement was definitely noticeable at Space over the weekend. Like I mentioned in my last post, the talented Roger Sanchez was on the decks. One of the few DJs on the scene not caught up with doing stage shows and 90-minute sets, Roger kept us going for over nine hours, from 3 AM - 12 noon. I broke my "Leave Space at 8:30" rule by a fair margin. It was worth it though. A lot of old friends showed up, and stayed late, so I figured I would as well. As a single guy, I kind of go where my friends are, ya know?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/rs-6661.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The S-Man himself!'" ></p>

<p>But Roger definitely delivered on the musical end. I'm not much of a trainspotter ("It's the song that goes mmmm-tsss right?") but he kept the crowd occupied with a great mix of diverse music, ranging from vocal-infused house to extended tribal percussive tracks. Which kept the people there socializing and dancing and drinking. A successful night for Space, by any metric. And a great photographic journey for me. I report what's there, and if what is there isn't interesting or compelling, it comes through in my work. And if it is interesting and compelling, it will definitely show. If you are of a mind, <a href="http://seenightlife.com/users/pod/albums/roger-sanchez-returns-to-space">click here</a> to see the end results. It's a bit of a large gallery due to the length of time I was present at Space, but there you have it.</p>

<p>The fall is here!</p>

<p>A random blog post over at <a href="http://www.faithfanzine.com/?p=1590">Faith Fanzine</a> caught my eye today. One quote from the article summed it up:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>When did we start watching a DJ instead of dancing with our mates , why do we put up with idiotic people taking up the floor who are filming the DJ ,why is the best dance floors now being cut to ribbons to provide extra table space for naff VIP’s ( Pacha in Ibiza hang your head in shame ) ,people with more money than taste and who in some extreme situations in the US have had DJs thrown off the decks because they did not like the music .</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Yes, when did we stop dancing?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>I can't dance, that's a given. I pop around and do monkey moves, get embarrassed, and then I shuffle off to the side. But in the end, I'm still interacting with the crowd and my friends, and squeezing in a few photo ops as I mix and mingle. I take a few (OK a lot in some cases!) photos of the DJ, but I'm not in the middle of the dancefloor gawking at the booth the entire night.</p>

<p>It's actually part of the reason I prefer clubs to the current form of dance music experience, the festival/concert setup.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://seenightlife.com/photos/5595/original_MIA-6086.jpg" width="427" height="640"></p>

<p>In those setups, there is a stage, and a general admission "pit", much like a rock concert. The setup works well for rock concerts, since the whole point of a live musical act performing on stage is so you can see them work their instruments and sing. The act of a DJ mixing, no matter what tools they use, is generally a very passive act, and doesn't lend itself much to a rock-performance aesthetic, no matter how much jumping around and handwaving the DJ is doing. Anything more than that (I'm looking at you, Aoki), smacks of being too contrived and "trying too hard". Essentially the guy playing other people's music in the club has been placed in the center of a stage usually reserved for rockstars. And no matter how many pretty LED screens and image-mapped 3D renderings one throws up there, it comes down to that he's still up there playing back prerecorded sounds in a predetermined sequence. And a lot of DJs in concert situations don't even alter their playlists much from date to date. Zero musical flexibility. Might as well put an iPhone up there and play a prerecorded mix.</p>

<p>Plus, the shows are often at capacity, so there is actually zero room for dancing, and certainly no room for social interaction, since everyone is either focused on the guy pressing play on their laptop, or has their head buried in their phone, stroking their ego on Facebook.</p>

<p>I'm generally regarded as a borderline sociopathic personality. However, I do value social interaction when I'm out for a night of entertainment. It's why I value the few clubs left that actually encourage social discourse and interaction. Venues in town like Space, the Vagabond, and so forth, while they book DJ talent, don't rely on the DJ exclusively to drive their business. Some of my best nights out have been with the local guys on the decks, and I'm just there with my friends, having a good time. Some DJs still get it. <a href="http://seenightlife.com/users/pod/albums/pete-tong-at-space">Pete Tong</a> is a great example. This past weekend, he took to the decks at Space. No grandstanding, no tricks, he just played a great soundtrack to a night/morning out, and the crowd responded in kind. People were dancing, socializing, and having a good time, but not buried in their phones or gawking at the booth for hours on end. So there's hope...</p>

<p>Let's save the rockstar setup for the rockstars.</p>

    <link href="http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/on-the-premise-of-exclusivity/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-06T19:12:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/on-the-premise-of-exclusivity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ex.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'MK II overlooking Space'" ></p>

<p>Over the years, a lot of people have been under the mistaken assumption that I've been the "exclusive" photographer for venues and events I've worked with.</p>

<p>I don't enforce or expect exclusivity, and here's why...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At the root of it all, I'm only one person. I can only be in so many places within a venue at once, especially if it's a large scale venue such as Space. I'll be upstairs on the Terrace, but the Loft might be uncovered, or the Ballroom. There isn't money in the budget to clone me.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that photographers prior to me didn't enforce exclusivity with their venue clients was an enormous boost to me being able to do what I do today. If they hadn't left that door open, I might not have been as far along as I am today. However, back when I got started, the position/gig of "club photographer" was a rare one indeed. More on that in a minute.</p>

<p>And, if I were a large-scale venue manager/owner, and I had it in the budget, I would definitely want multiple photographic perspectives on what was going on that evening. Each and every person who picks up a camera has their own thoughts and ideas on how an image should come out, and it is a definite advertising boon to have those multiple perspectives represented. And in the case of email-harvesting sites posing as photo sites, the venue gets multiple sources of data. I don't necessarily approve of the tactic, but it is what it is, and if I were a venue owner or manager, I would avail myself of a few of those sites.</p>

<p>Finally, to be honest, enforcing exclusivity and being "the guy" is a real <em>pain</em>. You're expected to be everywhere at once, cover the event exactly in the style the client wants, which may not be your style, and the task of club photographer rapidly turns from a fun profession to a "job", i.e. something you have to do to make money. And, frankly, I can think of many healthier activities that aren't fun to do at all, that would earn me the same money or more that I do documenting the nightclub scene. I do it primarily because I love to do it, and the financial benefits are just the icing on the cake. You don't see people clamoring to spend thousands of dollars on camera equipment just to take it into a smoke-filled room with loud music and sloppy drunk people because it's a job.</p>

<p>However, the situation today could be regarded as a little different. Since I got started, the position of club photographer has gone from a rare job description, to one of almost ubiquity. Often, the last thing a party would consider is booking a photographer to document an event. It was usually a "6 PM on the night of the event" request, if they thought about it at all. Of course the internet changed that.</p>

<p>Now, if you throw a party at a club, it's expected that you will have at least one or two guys on hand to document the event. However, some venues tend to go a little overboard, thinking any exposure is good, and let any guy with an SLR and an excuse into the venue. With the modern set of circumstances in mind, I'd at least require that the shooter have a full-fledged website (and not just a Facebook page or Flickr gallery) with which their images were to be posted. And, I'd probably cap the amount of shooters within a venue to a certain amount to avoid "shooting gallery" syndrome where there is, in fact, ten or more shooters in a venue. So, exclusivity on one person, not so much, but not overkill like some places are now. Especially if you add in everyone with their iPhones blazing away. But that's for another rant.</p>

<p>If you're in the club shooting world, keep shooting. Don't expect or enforce exclusivity though, it's not practical and definitely not in the spirit of things. There's enough subject matter for all (well, most) of us.</p>

    <updated>2012-08-31T15:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/08/31/i-guess-i-am-becoming-a-car-guy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/210hella960.jpg" width="960" height="360" title="'210 Hella'" ></p>

<p>I took my E320 "the 210" in for some service at the excellent locally-owned repair shop, <a href="http://masterclassauto.com/">Masterclass Automotive</a> this morning. I got the headlamp lenses swapped for spanking new Hellas and some odd DTC codes diagnosed.</p>

<p>A year or so ago, I didn't know what a DTC code was and I sure as hell didn't care. Am I becoming a 'car guy'?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>Those who have known me for more than a few months know, that for the longest time, I was a dedicated bus rider/taxicab user. I had a monthly Metropass (superseded by the Easy Card) for over ten years. Not out of any sense of financial restriction (well OK at some points of time, yes...), but more out of a sense of convenience.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/thebus.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'The Bus'" ></p>

<p>However, during my temporary exile to Vegas, I was pretty much forced into getting a personal vehicle. Vegas has public transport, but it only covered about 30 percent of the valley, and even then only during daytime hours. Forget about nighttime buses.</p>

<p>At first, AMG was kind enough to provide me with a rental for the times I was actually on the ground in Vegas. It was a serviceable Ford Focus, and did the job as it were. But spending $2K+ a month to give me wheels didn't quite fit their budget, so after my Tiësto tour gig and prior to me running out the lease in Vegas, I had to acquire my own vehicle. A few options presented themselves, most notably of which was the vehicle I now own, the Mercedes E320.</p>

<p>Now, not being a car expert as it were, I had to call on some assistance to evaluate the purchase. So, I called on a friend of mine out there who owned a shop, to help me evaluate the Benz. In not so many words, it turned out to be a gem. It ran stable and was a good performer for the price, and he left it at "If you don't buy it, I will...". So, sold! I was suddenly a Mercedes owner.</p>

<p>However, as it is an older vehicle, I was advised to get it serviced and any minor repairs dealt with. I guess this is where my inherent geekiness kicked in. Whenever I purchase a new device, be it a camera, lens, phone, laptop, hard drive, or whatever, I research the hell out of it. I look for the obvious pros and cons, and also any tweaks, upgrades, hacks, and tricks to getting the most out of the device.</p>

<p>But, I guess I never considered a car as being a "device". Suddenly, this whole new world opened up to me. DTC codes, OBD-II ports, chassis numbers, ECU patches and upgrades, tire ratings, curb weights, bus voltages, optimal ranges for RPMs, fuel efficiency, horsepower, etc. It was like dissecting a computer component but there's moving parts and physics to call into account too. I guess I got hooked. And, from a pure tech perspective, it's great. I actually enjoy the research and the challenge of keeping the W210 up to spec and beyond.</p>

<p>Sidebar: Mercedes, like other manufacturers, typically assigns chassis numbers to certain classes of vehicles. For example, the W210 chassis encompasses the model years 1998-2002 and specifically the E320, E430, E300 turbodiesel, E55 AMG, and a few other models. Most enthusiasts of the brand refer to their cars by the chassis number in addition to the model number. Total geek thing.</p>

<p>But anyways, I guess my inherent need to break something down into it's components and see how it all works comes into play. I found out that the headlamp lenses could be replaced, for example. And yes, the more you know, the more you can save by doing things yourself or getting a good lead on what the mechanic will be doing. Each headlamp lens I had swapped in this morning was $85.00 as opposed to $300.00 for the entire housing if I just went with a dealer.</p>

<p>I also actually plan on getting an OBD-II dongle which interfaces with my iPhone. More stats and numbers to obsess over.</p>

<p>And I guess somewhere along the way I started becoming a "car guy". It's a fun diversion.</p>

<p>Now, of course I'm smart about it. I really only drive when I have to, and I still avail myself of public options when it's convenient or safe to do so, hence my retaining of my Easy Card and having a Car 2 Go membership. Keeping those options around (I switched my Easy Card to "refill when needed") doesn't cost any money unless you use it, so it's nice to have a "B" and "C" option, and a "too cheap to ride a cab and am going out for a drink or five" option too.</p>

<p>So, some of the "old Pod" still remains. Go figure.</p>
