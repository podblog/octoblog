<p>Like I've stated before. I don't really do what I do with the end-goal of money in my sights. Having money is nice, and certainly has it's benefits in today's society, but I've found along the way that if your driving force is solely the acquisition of it, and the conspicuous consumption of it, it will corrupt. I've seen some really good people turn into <em>raging assholes</em> because of it. Or just plain old douchebags. Pardon my language.</p>

<p>I do what I do because I really love to do it. Photo work, video work, and the occasional web project keep me happy and put food on the table, and allow for a balance in my life to spend with friends and family. I don't expect any sort of accolade or reward.</p>

<p>But occasionally they do come in.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I tend to laugh off social networking as a diversion and, at the business level, a potential waste of resources. The most successful businesspeople in the world that I personally know and know of didn't build their empires by posting Facebook posts and ads, but they did it pretty much by turning out a good product or service. Yes, you gotta get the word out, but the business will come to you after that initial push.</p>

<p>But, anyways, I was talking about social networking, not business. Oh, by the way, I don't have much in the way of business acumen. I can tell you what camera or computer to buy, but beyond that, you're on your own.</p>

<p>Social networking, right. Yes, it's mostly a diversion and a front for large-scale data mining that would make the KGB envious, but sometimes it does have it's moments.</p>

<p>Like tonight. The person in the Facebook chat window above friend-requested me earlier this evening. Now, I didn't quite recognize this person off the bat, but we had enough mutual known friends for me to theorize that we had met at some point in the past. So, I figured I would "clear" this person and take it from there. If they proved to be a spammer or an unscrupulous promoter, it would take all of five seconds to screen them. Facebook does do things right on occasion.</p>

<p>About a few minutes later, the above message came through. I was out on a run and unfortunately the person was offline by the time I got back, so realtime communication wasn't possible. However, at the risk of being sappy, that did make my night. Again, I don't expect awards or accolades for my work, but when they come in completely unsolicited, it does make my day.</p>

<p>Thank you kind semi-stranger. You made my night.</p>

<p>OK, back to my scheduled ranting and raving.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/isaacgram.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'Isaac Weekend'" ></p>

<p>I think this past weekend was a good example of what I've heard some people refer to as a "South Florida Snow Day"...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As I alluded to in the last post, Tropical Storm (and potential future hurricane) Isaac popped up on the South Florida cultural radar this past week. The usual cautionary tales ensued, with speculation turning to preparation on Thursday and Friday. Friday, the rain started to show up, with Saturday becoming a complete washout.</p>

<p>By Saturday night though, it appeared Isaac would only be a low-grade tropical storm, and the worst of it was to miss South Florida entirely, and veer through the Keys and out into the Gulf. But, the machinery of closures was already in motion. It definitely reminded me of the snow days growing up...</p>

<p>I grew up in the Northeast. As such, we had snow days when I was in school. If a storm happened, often the roads would be rendered dangerous, and as we were a walking/drive-your-kids-to-and-from-school district (only the special needs kids got buses), it was considered a liability to have kids out and about going to and from school in the event of a snow emergency. So, early in the morning of the day of the storm, the powers that be over at the school district HQ, would decide to declare a snow day, or not. They sometimes erred on the side of caution, choosing to close the district even if the accumulation wasn't that bad. So, there'd be three inches of snow on the ground (a laughable amount), and school would be closed.</p>

<p>Much like yesterday (Monday) with regards to Isaac. I woke up Monday morning, and was surprised to see the sun was out. However, the day prior, Sunday, was a complete rain event, as they say, and the governments and major businesses had already called off their Monday operations. I guess in the case of government, it's hard to recall a shutdown. However, it did rain a lot Monday afternoon, and I think it was a much-needed day off for a lot of people, personally. Though with remote work capabilities and telecommuting, the economy probably didn't suffer too much.</p>

<p>I think it was as close to a perfect situation in terms of disruption as you can get though. Enough rain came around to cause government and big business to shut down, but not so much as to engender widespread devastation and chaos. In practical matters, people got time off, and South Florida's party machine kicked into action over the weekend. It was "slow", of course, but most bars and nightclubs had enough business to justify staying open. I wonder what that says for society when we'll go through hell and high water to get drunk? Probably that we spend too much time at work, personally. But, that's another blog rant.</p>

<p>The party machine around was definitely active, with the events I attended at Chalk on South Beach, and of course Space in Downtown Miami, being heavily attended.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/classics-3797.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Space Classics'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/fuji-3505.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Chalk'" ></p>

<p>I've been through a few rain events and hurricanes, and despite the threat of damage and destruction, I've always kind of liked the atmosphere at hurricane parties. Plus, nothing beats exiting a venue and realizing, rather dimly, that you probably should get home and see about getting things situated in case the storm really does come. I remember when Hurricane Wilma, the last storm of any significance to come through South Florida directly, came through in October of 2005. I was living on Normandy Isle in the northern part of Miami Beach at the time in a fairly rattletrap (Sorry Su, it's true...but we had fun!) apartment building, and I got around via public transport or taxis. I had shot an event with Sander Kleinenberg at Space earlier, and made my usual late exit from the venue that Sunday morning. Of course, I had heard reports that this pesky storm might just come for us, but didn't give it much thought. I had gotten home, checked a few reports, most of which centered on "Yes, it's coming for Miami, but at what strength we don't know...", and passed out to sleep. I woke up about eight hours later to the sounds of my roommate and his friend stocking up for the storm. Apparently it was close, as we lost power a few hours later. Fortunately we had enough random provisions to get through the next few days, but for a minute it was kind of tense as we had no "real" food.</p>

<p>I'm a little more responsible nowadays, I think. I have a few gallons of water on hand and a FIVESTAR account with hotels.com. And I keep an eye on my iPhone during potential hurricane periods. If things look ugly, I'll prebook a hotel inland and north and get out of town. Might not be the most entertaining course of action, but fortunately I'm mobile. I can fit everything important to me (gear, data, and some clothes) into my trunk. And if the storm is a non-event, I can come back home.</p>

<p>It might not work for you though. Don't blame me if it doesn't.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/08/25/cruising-south-florida</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets.jpg" width="960" height="960" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p>Apparently there's a hurricane on the way. Or a tropical storm at the most. It's the usual subdued panic in South Florida. Yes, I'm aware that even a tropical storm can cause damage, and it's always better to be safe than sorry, but if the news media is to be believed, Armageddon is upon us.</p>

<p>It made for a very low-key Friday night, that's for sure. And today is shaping up to be more of the same.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Which is actually OK with me. I like to kick back and relax and do what I want rather than what I need to do. And one of those things is cruising around and shooting the deserted streets at night. In my mind, it's similar, in a way, to the scenics and landscapes I've been shooting lately. There's definitely an interesting juxtaposition with the works of humanity in the photo, but humanity itself isn't present.</p>

<p>And last night made that easy. No one was out, anywhere. I ostensibly drove north on the express lanes in I-95 to try out a new set of tires I put on the W210 earlier in the day. Bridgestone RE970s if anyone is curious. And in the rain at cruising speed, they stuck to the road like glue, even at "autobahn" speeds of 130 kph...around 81 mph or so.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://distilleryimage5.instagram.com/e1e54fdeee6a11e1829522000a1e88aa_7.jpg" title="'I-95 NB Express'" ></p>

<p>Of course I had my gear on me, since I intended on getting off the beaten path and shooting some deserted streets. From Downtown Fort Lauderdale to Washington Avenue on South Beach to Wynwood in Miami, it was a quiet Friday night. There were small bursts of activity here and there, but it was definitely a slow night. Which suited me just fine. I captured some excellent deserted street scenes.</p>

<p>One of the challenges, of course, was keeping my camera dry. I kind of forgot about that. However, I improvised with a plastic bag from my trunk and a musty old t-shirt to wipe away any condensation. And even though I had my trusty Manfrotto tripod with me, I handheld all of my images from the past evening. ISO 3200 and 6400. Don't fear the noise.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets-3454.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets-3462.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets-3473.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/streets-3476.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Streets of SFL'" ></p>

<p>Driving Washington Avenue was fun. I drove from 5th Street to Lincoln, and marveled at all the shuttered nightclub spaces. It's really the subject of another rant, but it's amazing to see the huge seasonal turnover in nightclubs on the Beach. You think these guys would realize there's only three big players in town and only so many people to go around.</p>

<p>Anyways, it was a successful street scene shooting session. This wasn't commercially motivated, it was all "just for me". I think in the quest to stay solvent, a lot of photographers forget to go out and shoot what they want in addition to what they need to shoot. Though a fortunate few can shoot what they want and it fills their needs quite nicely. Regardless, shooting what you want is definitely recommended. It's relaxing if anything. Strip your kit down to what you need (again, don't fear the noise), get out there, and press the shutter button.</p>

<p>Be safe out there, South Florida.</p>

<p>Looks like Car 2 Go heard the noise I was making...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I don't do advertorial or paid postings, it defeats the purpose of this blog, in my mind. Anything I talk about or endorse here is based on personal experience and not because someone paid me off. If I think something is useful or quality, I'll post about it here. <a href="http://miami.car2go.com/">Car 2 Go</a> is definitely a great service and worth what I pay for it. Keep up the good work guys.</p>

<p>I've been through the advertorial wringer before. It's fun for a few minutes while you get paid, but after awhile, if you are posing as a legitimate news source, it does get tiring after awhile if you have any sort of humanity.</p>

<p>The sad thing is, advertisers and companies have come to expect advertorial as a standard practice these days. I've been around plenty of people and corporations when the question of the media and coverage for their product/brand/event comes up, and a notable amount of the discussion does center on the advertorial side of things. What's even worse, is when you see what appear to be respectable news outlets going along for the advertorial ride.</p>

<p>Listen, as far as pure journalism goes, it's a tough world out there now. Ad sales have dried up, and obviously it costs money to operate and maintain a decent news outlet. However, there are ways to cut costs and still maintain standards of ethical and journalistic integrity. A lot of "fat" can be cut on the infrastructure side of things, for example. This very blog is an example. While I don't have it configured for true high-availability, I know I could scale it up as such where having this blog as an HA app wouldn't break the bank. A little knowledge goes a long way.</p>

<p>I think, at the end of the day, journalists and news organizations should embrace being a bit multi-talented, enabling them to continue delivering unbiased news, without having to resort to deceptive advertorial processes.</p>

<p>And yes, I know the guilty parties in the advertorial game. Let's just say it's not too surprising. I'll keep my own counsel for now.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/08/15/the-best-camera-is-the-one-you-have-on-you</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="http://gallery.photo.net/photo/1232337-md.jpg" width="766" height="504" title="'Miami 2000'" ></p>

<p>The above is one of my favorite images that I've taken. The gear used consisted of a $200 Pentax ZX-5n film SLR, a roll of $8 Fuji 400 film I bought in a drugstore, and an $80 chunk of Sigma glass with no special features other than a macro function. It shows the Metromover tracks near the original location of Club Space, looking south towards Brickell. This was prior to the AA Arena, the "Biscayne Wall" of condos such as Ten Museum Park, 900 Biscayne, The Everglades, and so on, as well as more recent additions like The Marquis. Almost a Miami of old at this point.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>However, I managed to capture the subtle tones of the sunrise and the remnants of the evening mixed with the street and track lighting. Kind of an early attempt at my current fascination with scenics, I guess.</p>

<p>Without my description, most would have guessed I captured this with a decent digital SLR, or if they had an eye for Miami and the time depicted, a fairly top-of-the-range film body and lens. The reality is, I grabbed this frame with less than $300 worth of equipment. On film. Most club photographers have never touched film. I still have to take action on this, but one of these weekends, I'm going to shoot a few rolls of film at Space for the hell of it.</p>

<p>A lot of photographers, professional and otherwise, are victims of gear lust. Sure, I am too, but since I got started, I always tried to hold true to the ethic of "The best camera is the one you have on you".</p>

<p>It's akin to what is taught in military academies around the country, "You go to war with the army you have, not the one you want". You are basically limited by your situation and your budget. Budget, obviously, because not every working professional can justify or afford a 1-series Canon body or a Nikon D4. And situationally, since it isn't always practical to carry around a large digital SLR and several lenses everywhere you go.</p>

<p>For the longest time, I shot with crop-frame mid-range digital SLRs. My work level and situation made stepping up to a full-frame body like the 5D MK II an unrealistic proposition. Maybe not so unrealistic, but more of me being cautious. My existing camera bodies generated superb images in my hands, and there was no pressing need to upgrade. I only finally upgraded to the 5D MK II when it made sense for me to do so, since several clients were asking for video work, and the 5D MK II made the most sense for my shooting style. And even then, the 5D MK II was a three year-old piece of hardware, which still generated superb images in the hands of an experienced shooter.</p>

<p>But regardless, due to the situation I was in at the time, I lacked independent transport. I took the bus everywhere. And I bought my SLR kit with me, out of necessity, since I'd often be on my way to or from a shoot. Even if I wasn't specifically shooting something, I always feared I'd get a call-up to shoot something right away, and my gear would be several bus rides or an expensive cab journey away, if I didn't have it on me. Very cumbersome way of conducting business. Obviously when I acquired my own independent transport, this became less of a problem as I could stow my gear in my trunk (a scary proposition in some areas), or keep it at home, but still be able to buzz back to base and snag it if the need arose.</p>

<p>However, the news or "that specific situation" doesn't always wait for me to rocket down I-95 at 100 MPH and skid over to my apartment to pick up my gear. So, the camera I may have on me at that moment is my iPhone 4s. The cameras inside phones have come a long way. The 4s is still, as of this writing, the undisputed champ in my mind, especially when coupled with decent photo apps from the App Store. One of my favorites is <a href="http://www.awesomize.com/"> Camera Awesome</a>. Developed by Smugmug, Camera Awesome has an ingenious system for focusing, exposure, as well as a basic suite of post-production tools, enabling you to crank out an acceptable JPEG in a hurry if the need arises. It also integrates with Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, and standard email.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ca.png" width="640" height="960" title="'Camera Awesome'" ></p>

<p>I've cranked out plenty of what I consider decent images using this little app. Several more exist, such as Hipstamatic and so forth, but Camera Awesome seems to be more geared towards those with a modicum of photo knowledge.</p>

<p>With this in mind, I actually don't freak out as much when I leave my MK II behind, like if I am going out to a purely social occasion somewhere and it's impractical or impolite to be carrying a giant bag of gear around, and maybe not the best idea in the world to leave it in the trunk of your vehicle. Since, I know I have my iPhone with a decent app close at hand, and know how to work with and around it's limitations. I won't be generating prize-winning work anytime soon with my iPhone, but I'm actually pretty impressed with the results. I work with the camera I have on me when the situation arises, I don't muck about wishing I bought my full-size rig. Though that being said, 95 percent of the time I do have my equipment within ten feet of me. It's the 5 percent of the rest of the time I've learned to calm down about and not worry about it. I know I can pop off a decent iPhone photo at any time if the situation demands it.</p>

<p>I'm of course not suggesting everyone ditch their SLRs for iPhones, but at the same time, don't be susceptible to gear lust. Sometimes you just need to make do with what you have. And actually, when you work with what you have, a lot of the time, the end results will surprise you.</p>

<p>FYI, if anyone is interested in seeing my attempts at iPhone photography, check out my Instacanvas gallery (prints of my Instagrams) at <a href="http://instacanv.as/pod_gram">instacanv.as/pod_gram</a>. It's cheap!</p>
