<p>As of right, President Barack Obama has secured his spot for a second term as President of these United States. To most observers, it wasn't entirely unexpected, but his challenger, Mitt Romney, did put up a good fight, appealing to the "rest of America", as it were, rather than focusing on the urban centers in the states with high electoral votes, as Obama did. In essence, it created the same split the US had four years ago. The map looks much the same, with the coasts being "blue" and the interior of the country being "red"...</p>

<p>In my travels I've visited each and every state in the Lower 48. At the base level, life will go on for each and every citizen of the US, much as it has had for them over the course of their lives. Whether there's a Democrat or a Republican in the White House, their lives will go on. They will grow up, get jobs, maybe get married, maybe kick out a few kids, get old, and pass on, regardless of their location or political affiliation. Sure, economic conditions and the overall mood of the country do change (we are, as a lot, more miserable now than twenty years ago), but the overall lifestyle and conditions have remained pretty steady. Most of us have a roof over our heads and food on the table, which means we're ahead of most of the world by a fair margin.</p>

<p>If we want to effect true change in our lives and political system, we can't rely on just electing a different face of the same system every four years. Politicians may enter the world of politics with the best of ideals, but once in, they are either corrupted by power, or beaten down by the depth of the problems with our system, and they do the government equivalent of collecting a paycheck and just go through the motions.</p>

<p>To effect these changes, some have looked to the "third parties" in the US political system. Ranging from serious politicians such as ex-Republican governor of New Mexico <a href="http://garyjohnson2012.com/">Gary Johnson</a> of the <a href="http://lp.org/">Libertarian Party</a> to publicity hounds like Roseanne Barr, the world of third-party politics is a diverse and wild one. Unfortunately, as it stands, no one has yet to make a serious dent in the two-party system. Johnson may or may not have come close, but as of this writing, it's hard to find out whether he crossed the "magic" threshold of getting 5 percent of the popular vote. This threshold, if crossed, would permit the Libertarian Party to qualify for matching campaign funds from the government in the next election cycle, a major bonus.</p>

<p>Now, I tend to focus on the Libertarians a lot, mainly because that is my registered party affiliation. It isn't a big secret that I have a distaste for big central government. I see big central government much like I see a big corporation. The government (corporation) only holds itself up to it's biggest shareholders (the corporations in this case!) and disregards the interests of the individual citizen. What the Libertarian platform seeks to accomplish is to scale back government to the bare minimums needed to maintain a cohesive nation, and decentralize a lot of functions that are currently central, allowing for a more responsive form of government. Note, for the record, Libertarians aren't anarchists or corporatists. The philosophy at it's root level actually allows for debate and discussion on the form of government itself, actually. Some who identify as Libertarians are borderline anarchists, sure, but most are just decent citizens looking to live their lives with a minimum of active government interference, but also expecting that the government should be there to discharge it's prescribed duties, whatever those may be at a given moment.</p>

<p>For example, the Libertarian take on war is that it is generally a bad thing. A Libertarian government shouldn't conduct offensive campaigns, only defensive. Thus, the government is responsible for the safety of it's taxpayers from external threats. This also obviously extends to basic police functions as well. I'm actually of the same bent. If I'm paying taxes, even if they are minimal, I would want the body I'm paying taxes into, to be able to take care of me and keep me safe. Sure, I'm pro-Second Amendment. When seconds count, the cops are minutes away, after all, but if you step it up a level, a Walther PPS isn't really going to matter much against a full-on army. I would expect a government to provide a small standing force to do that for me.</p>

<p>Much along the same lines, and where I kind of split with the general party line (again, the party generally welcomes dissent and debate), is that the government should provide a basic form of emergency health care, covered by taxes. With the abolition of many government agencies, basic healthcare could be provided, even at a lower tax rate. After all, if I'm healthy, I'm able to work and pay taxes into the system. If I'm sick or infirm, I'm not able to work.</p>

<p>Beyond making sure the citizens are safe and healthy, the government should be hands-off. However, under the current system, that just isn't possible. There is an entire industry built around a two-party strong central government system. Lobbyists, contractors, bureaucrats, and so many others depend on this very system for their livelihood. The system in place isn't interested in the welfare of it's citizens, it is only interested in safeguarding it's existence in perpetuity. Much like the fictional "Matrix", some people are so plugged in and dependent, they'll stop at nothing to ensure the survival of their system.</p>

<p>Thus, beyond the change in government, we need a sea change in society for true progress to be made. Less and less, we should look to big government to solve all our ills, or big business for that matter. People need to get off of their social media and reality show addictions and get involved in the political process, before their right to do so is gradually usurped. The right to keep and bear arms could be revoked tomorrow and only a few NRA lobbyists would raise a fuss, but if someone set off an EMP weapon in each Facebook data center, there would be a mass insurrection. Bread and circuses keep the masses in check. People bitch about their privacy rights all the time, but they'll share every bowel movement on Facebook, like it matters. That's a personal pet peeve of mine. Fact is, even if I like you, I don't care. Spare me the mundane. Let me know when you do something interesting. Checking in at your cubicle is not interesting. Oops, nearly went off track there.</p>

<p>Also, we need to reawaken the spirit of "Do It Yourself" in this country. Now, I'm not suggesting we all become aircraft mechanics and architects and build our own personal planes and buildings, but at the same time, I'm shocked at the lack of general knowledge of the way things work in some of the people around me. Now, grant it, I'm certainly deficient in some of these areas (until recently, cars were a 'stomp-on-gas-pedal-and-go-that-way' affair to me), but I'm actually amazed at the overall level of ignorance I encounter. I think a spirit of "DIY" would encourage more government participation by the citizens.</p>

<p>Now, this could be a double-edged sword. People may not always think about what is best for the community, but what is best for them. For example, outlawing abortion might suit the family down the street just fine, but might not ring true for the struggling single mom-to-be down the street. Where people definitely need to mind their own business is in matters of the body, so to speak. My body, my rules. As long as my mistakes only harm me, I should be allowed to make them without penalty or interference. Abortion, drug use, even assisted suicide, aka "death with dignity" should be decisions left to the individual, not others. At the end of the day, the Libertarian ideal is about individual freedom. Right now, there is a severe lack of it in this country. Sure, there's a lot we can do, but at the same time, there is a lot we cannot do, that we should be able to do, especially when it comes to ourselves.</p>

<p>I didn't mean for this to turn into a pro-Libertarian rant, OK, maybe I did, but nonetheless, the issues are still staring us in the face, even though our everyday life continues unabated, and even though at a basic level, for most of us, it isn't that bad.</p>

<p>But, it could be better. My ideas and concepts could actually make accomplishing that quite easy. And, of course, if you just choose to kick back and figure out things as you go along, that's alright too. It is your right as a human being to do the amount of work you think is necessary to be happy. For some this involves 16-hour days festering under fluorescent tubes. For others, this involves being outdoors and building things. For others, it kind of involves a lot of random things. It's your life, neither the government, your friends, parents, families, talking heads on TV, self-help gurus, priests, rabbis, imams, or swamis need to be in the business of telling you how to live it.</p>

<p>Now, with the current federal election over, Obama has four more years to deliver on his promises. Being human, he won't deliver on them all, but the American people just granted him an extension. While I hope he delivers on some, and misses the ball on others, I do know it's up to us to keep an eye on him and the government as a whole, and gradually try to effect the sea change I spoke about earlier. Revolutions don't happen overnight, even in this day and age. Patience is key.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/appnet.png" width="781" height="446" title="'alpha dot app dot net slash pod'" ></p>

<p>I've recently jumped onto a new social networking service called <a href="http://join.app.net/">app.net</a>. Founded by <a href="http://daltoncaldwell.com/">Dalton Caldwell</a>, app.net is, at a basic level, an ad-free version of Twitter. You basically pay $5 a month or $36 a year to join, and from there it's pretty smooth sailing. Like any new service online, there's a small fanatical userbase laying the groundwork for the new community, including the "tone"...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>A few years ago, when <a href="http://www.technogeno.us/">Ryan</a> and I were kicking off <a href="http://talknightlife.com/">TNL</a>, one of the things we thought about was setting the standard for discourse in the community. The initial way we did this was via an invite system. We basically told people we knew and liked about the new site, gave them the gateway password, and told them to have at it while we built it. We invited people we knew were capable of intelligent discourse, as well as deliberately inviting a few "disruptive" elements, just to see if our little idea of the community setting the tone worked. For the most part, it did. Where our previous community frequently walked the line with porn, spam, and some pretty vicious personal battles, the TNL experiment proved to be mild in comparison. (Yes, mild...I wish we exported the blue site DB before we got shown the door, there were some real gems in there!) However, in general, it seemed to prove a point that an online community, especially a niche one, is capable of being largely self-regulating.</p>

<p>But, if a community grows to be amazingly large, can it self-police? It's hard to say. Look at Facebook. Even if you have a limited friend list, you are still subject to the content they post, and they generally take influence from their friends, and so on. So, Facebook has devolved into a mindless mash of memes, chain letters, tabloid news, and general idiocy. However, objectively, sometimes general idiocy can be fun. I'll gladly admit to laughing at the latest meme. I love "Me Gusta" ragefaces and the "Because 'Fuck You', That's Why!" meme actually kind of sums up how I feel about most things I do. However, the general tone of Facebook is one of a shopping mall with disinterested mall cops who only do what they have to do, in order to keep their jobs. And the self-policing actions are generally arbitrary. People will laugh at a video of a guy getting hit by a train, but not if it originated from someone they have a problem with. Then it's game on, they're clicking "hide/report" for all it's worth.</p>

<p>Twitter isn't much better off. Due to it's nature it is limited to short messages, but now that they have to make money, they are injecting ads into every available nook and cranny of the service. Which, since it's a free service, they have every right to. It's basically the mall, but you can only say things in short sentences. Very chaotic, and of course prone to brain-dropping syndrome.</p>

<p>Now, app.net is far smaller than both Facebook and Twitter. As of last count, they have less than 30,000 users. Which isn't bad for a service that is not owned by a major corporation, and explicitly asks you to pay money for access, in exchange for providing a clean and friendly environment. It is the VIP lounge of the social networking scene. Well, back when VIP lounges actually were VIP anyhow.</p>

<p>The virtue of this small paywall is that it tends to keep the casual user out. When you have an open social network or community site, basically anyone with something to say can come by. Now, I'm all about giving people the freedom to express themselves, but on the internet, the price of that freedom is spam and a lower quality of conduct. On a free network, that is. Spammers aren't going to pay to access a small community of individuals who have no interest in their products, and anyone with a "casual" opinion or an insult isn't going to pay money just to rattle someone's cage. With app.net, it has led to a general atmosphere of camaraderie and educated discourse. While the language itself is as "free" as any other site, it's generally used in context, and not just for the sake of saying "fuck" every third word. And the feeling is generally virulent. The user feels he or she needs to be at the level of the community in order to engage them. I post on there a few times a day, and I'm usually pretty cautious about how I phrase myself. Now, one of the virtues of app.net is an open API. You pay a little extra for access, but it allows for a whole host of third-party applications and tie-ins. Today, I started using an <a href="http://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a>recipe to link my Instagram feed to app.net. While something like this is encouraged as it makes app.net more appealing, I almost feel that I should maybe de-link it, since some of my Instagrams are a bit low-brow for the community.</p>

<p>However, it seems app.net, with it's spirit of dissatisfaction against the status quo of monolithic and exploitative social networks like Facebook and Twitter, is proving on a larger scale, that the early adopters can and do set the tone and unwritten code of conduct for a web community and social network. It will be an interesting experiment to watch, especially if it catches fire in a major way. How will advertisers approach a community that has no love for their techniques, but still uses their products anyways? How will they advertise in a place with no advertising mechanism? Will app.net cancel the accounts of spammers? Those questions do remain. I can see "guerrilla marketers" and so-called "social media consultants" signing up at the least. Those types of people lose sleep over the fact that somewhere in the world, there's a social media service they aren't a part of. God forbid their already-rigged metrics slip half a percentage point. Wait till they find out there's services in China with half-a-billion members who conduct their daily discourse entirely in Mandarin. They'll be running down to the mall kiosks to buy Rosetta Stone - Mandarin Edition.</p>

<p>Thankfully app.net has a very prominent blocking feature.</p>

<p>The way I see it developing is much like TV networks such as HBO did. People specifically pay money to access HBO, not only for it's quality unfiltered content, but because there are no obvious ads. I say 'obvious' since I do consider the little half-hour bits about stuff on HBO produced by HBO to be a form of advertising designed to keep you subscribed. Which is fine. It is the service merely preserving itself. I guess the app.net staff does the same thing, since Dalton actively participates in the community and keeps people informed on "what's next..."</p>

<p>Personally, I think it's the future. I think social media is going to go more "boutique", and less "mall", and people will have to adjust their thinking accordingly. The open internet will and should always still be there, but more and more, I see paid-for and niche social and community sites becoming the norm as people tire of the constant bombardment of advertisers on the large free services like Facebook and Twitter.</p>

<p>They aren't destined for failure either. I can actually see them adopting a two-tiered approach in the classic web fashion. Free access with ads, or pay a small monthly fee to remove them. They'll take a page from the small innovators like app.net and call it their own. However, to truly compete, they need more effective filters. An ad-free experience means nothing if there's still guerrilla marketers vying for your attention. "Hey Pod, haven't seen you in awhile, how's life? Oh really? Cool, well, ya know, I can get you 10,000 followers in a month if you act right now!".</p>

<p>But that's for another rant.</p>

<p>I think I'm going to go post some cat photos on Facebook and say the word 'fuck' a few times in succession. Then off to app.net and make recommendations on camera equipment.</p>

<p>You definitely can't argue with the sunsets on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Sure, sunset photos are contrived and "have been done", but sometimes, regardless of your skill level, every photographer needs to shoot a few "typical" images. If anything, for those of us who take ourselves too seriously, you can justify it as a "test" or "calibration" or "comparison".</p>

<p>Besides, it's rather nice-looking.</p>

<p>I think in terms of "a place to go to do nothing", Emerald Isle has Key West beat. There is absolutely nothing going on but the weather. No clubs, no bars, just some pretty pricey real estate and people just kicking back. You have to bring your own fun, essentially. Which was kind of nice.</p>

<p>While some tell me my strength lies in capturing images, I also have been told I can write well. However, in terms of writing, I do tend to ramble. Hence, this blog's tagline having the words "general ramblings"...</p>

<p>So, when someone asks for me to summarize something, it's nigh-impossible for me to do. So, if you asked me to sum up my own body of photographic work, I'd be at a loss to condense it to a sentence or two. I cringe at committing grammar crimes when I have to post to Twitter. The art of summary is lost to me.</p>

<p>However, someone summarized what I do so well for me just a few minutes ago...</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You have a vision and you wait for the world to fall in line and then you capture it...</p><footer><strong>Adriana D</strong> <cite>A Phone Conversation 12 October 2012</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>And <em>boom</em>, that sums it up.</p>

<p>I could sit here for hours expounding on noise levels, a-to-d conversions, electric fields emanating from poorly-shielded cabling, the native ISO of a given sensor, and don't-point-your-lens-at-a-10-watt-laser-you-fool type of things and it wouldn't be a summary of how I manage to pull off a shot. It'd be the Book of Pod so to speak. Which, some people like, and some people don't.</p>

<p>It actually speaks volumes about having an outside opinion.</p>

<p>I had just come back from a nighttime run (yes Ryan, I do run around this neighborhood at 1 AM) and I picked up a text conversation where I had left it off earlier. My friend Adriana had just moved from the construction mess called Brickell, to a cozy new joint on Collins Avenue in "Condo Canyon" with her boyfriend. She was inviting me over for a little housewarming thing tomorrow, and she mentioned the last thing she had picked up from her old apt was a piece of mine that she purchased back in 2009:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/frances_2008.jpg" width="640" height="960" title="'Frances at Space - 2008'" ></p>

<p>I had done an exhibit of some of my "dancer photos" at the first <a href="http://lifeisart.org">Life Is Art</a> exhibit in Wynwood. Life is Art, by <a href="http://soulofmiami.org">Soul of Miami</a> founder James Echols, is a local organization that supports up-and-coming artists of all stripes. Since that first open show in 2009, they've come a long way and are quite renowned in the art community, especially amongst artists who may not be "hip" enough to warrant the attention of some of the more corporate art organizations in town. Adriana, at the time, was their treasurer, and had expressed an interest in obtaining a print of one of my images, specifically the one above. So, her mom took it upon herself to pull me aside and purchase it from me for her. As my exhibit was digital (I didn't have the budget to produce 20 prints of size), I took the "order" and contacted my print provider to generate a canvas-framed print for me of this piece. A few weeks later, it was delivered to Adriana, to much acclaim. Oddly enough it's the only "dancer" piece I have ever sold. Either I just haven't marketed them properly or people don't go for half-naked girls in smoky nightclubs as <em>objets d'art</em>.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today. As pieces of art are often delicate, they are usually transported separately from other items in a moving adventure. Anyways, in a conversation about that piece tonight, Adriana was asking me about how I capture moments like that, and I did have a hard time summarizing it up. So, she put it into words that had previously escaped me:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You have a vision and you wait for the world to fall in line and then you capture it...</p><footer><strong>Adriana D</strong> <cite>A Phone Conversation 12 October 2012</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>And yes, that's it. Minus the technical details, which, if anyone asks, I'll gladly explain, that's pretty much it. I see the image in my head, and I wait for the world to fall in line. Whether it's in a club or below a deserted bridge in Key West, that's it. If I had to sum it up into a Twitter-friendly sentence, that is it.</p>

<p>Now, if I can summarize this post, it would be, "A different perspective always helps..."</p>

<p>Oh, and Ade, thanks!</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/10/10/on-mental-instability-dot-dot-dot</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lostios2012-9070.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The crazy ones.'" ></p>

<p>An article in the New York Times caught my eye today, on the subject of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/attention-disorder-or-not-children-prescribed-pills-to-help-in-school.html?_r=1&partner=rss&emc=rss&smid=tw-nytimes">medicating the children of our society</a> for a range of supposed mental illnesses.</p>

<p>Now, I don't condemn the benefits of modern medicine, and I also don't condemn the use of drugs recreationally. However, as odd as it may sound with this stance, I'm actually kind of against the overprescription of psychotropic medications.</p>

<p>For several reasons...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><blockquote><p>We’ve decided as a society that it’s too expensive to modify the kid’s environment. So we have to modify the kid.</p><footer><strong>Alan Schwarz interviews Dr Michael Anderson</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/attention-disorder-or-not-children-prescribed-pills-to-help-in-school.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes'>Attention Disorder or Not, Pills to Help in School</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I'm not an educational professional. I've been told I can convey knowledge rather effectively, but educational techniques are not in any of my various professional and non-professional job descriptions.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, I do pay attention to trends in society with regards to the educational methods being used to teach children today. And, frankly, the trend of medicating children this way scares me.</p>

<p>Objectively, it's lazy. The educators lack the patience to effectively deal with the children, so they fall back on a pharmaceutical solution. Now, I'll grant you that there may be children who genuinely need these medications just to function in daily life, but from the article above, it seems to reflect the now-obvious trend of seeing a pharmaceutical solution as a way out.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>On the Rocafort family’s kitchen shelf in Ball Ground, Ga., next to the peanut butter and chicken broth, sits a wire basket brimming with bottles of the children’s medications, prescribed by Dr. Anderson: Adderall for Alexis, 12; and Ethan, 9; Risperdal (an antipsychotic for mood stabilization) for Quintn and Perry, both 11; and Clonidine (a sleep aid to counteract the other medications) for all four, taken nightly.</p><footer><strong>Alan Schwarz</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/attention-disorder-or-not-children-prescribed-pills-to-help-in-school.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes'>www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I would call it a statistical norm if one of the children in the family described here required medicating, but when each and every child is on a spectrum of psychotropic drugs, there's clear evidence to suggest overprescription is at work here. Nevermind what Mom and Dad might be on.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>To help me focus on my school work, my homework, listening to Mom and Dad, and not doing what I used to do to my teachers, to make them mad,” he said. He described the week in the hospital and the effects of Risperdal: “If I don’t take my medicine I’d be having attitudes. I’d be disrespecting my parents. I wouldn’t be like this.</p><footer><strong>Alan Schwarz interviewing Quintn Rocafort, age 11</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/health/attention-disorder-or-not-children-prescribed-pills-to-help-in-school.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;smid=tw-nytimes'>www.nytimes.com/2012/10/09/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Listen, when I was 11, I was a disrespectful little shit. I regularly threw fits, pissed off my parents and teachers, and didn't have that many friends. Yeah, some things never change. However, I was usually lumped in, in terms of intelligence, with the "gifted" children, and the school (which was not well-funded!), sought out non-pharmaceutical solutions to my supposed problems. Now, this was the 1980s, so most of the drugs being prescribed to kids these days didn't exist, or if they did, it was never considered that they should be given to an 11 year-old child. Basically, the general gist in my case was "he'll grow out of it", or "If he keeps it up, someone will set him straight".</p>

<p>However, at no time were my supposed issues considered abnormal or irregular. If anything, the most my parents and teachers did was channel the energy into different areas where my spontaneity would be maximized. A child today who acted like I did, would be force-fed Adderall and told to get back to crunching away at math.</p>

<p>Joking and humor aside though, I managed to get through it and make the most of my mental attributes. I've never been to a therapist, and I've never been on a psychotropic regimen (I took Adderall once and it made me sick), and I manage to pay the bills, maintain a home, and have a social life inside and outside of my work. In other words, I'm in the ballpark with regards to most statistical norms in American society.</p>

<p>That being said, I do recognize my own mental quirks. I can't focus on something for more than ten or fifteen minutes at a time. My mind is always on fire in twenty different directions at once. Only if something truly engages me, can I get around this. For example, I can "zone out" and shoot for hours on end. I can write on subjects that interest me without deviating from the task. However, even with tasks I find pointless or uninteresting, if they need to get done, I'll get around to doing it by the time it needs to be completed. Usually.</p>

<p>I have a vague notion of time, and I question 95 percent of what crosses my path, so to speak. I'll deviate and spend an hour arguing with someone on how pointless something is. For example, a pet peeve of mine is people who take a hour to make a mundane decision, like, what to eat for lunch. My take on lunch or any meal is, "eat it and move on to the next thing...", since in my head, there's other things way more interesting than food. Give me a reasonably-healthy buffet or salad-bar style setup. I'd rather spend the time multitasking, i.e. I can eat and bang out a blog article, edit some photos, optimize some code, or be social. Food goes in one way, and it comes out another. Whoopee. I'm sure every foodie in town will want to kill me now.</p>

<p>I also have a hard time bringing people into my inner circle. I'm severely paranoid around new people. Though is it paranoia if they really are out to get you? But, with time, I'll bring people into the circle. Otherwise I'm pretty a pretty cold customer. Those who know me know the whole "sunglasses and 'I am smiling' " routine.</p>

<p>Sidebar: I had to deviate from writing this article to derive the media_id of that Instagram photo. It took a minute or two since I saw something that caught my eye along the way. Which made me think of something else, a way of getting that ID without having to kick the Instagram API. Which brings me to my point.</p>

<p>My point is, is that my mental quirks make me who I am. I'm a paranoid, random sort of guy who can't focus on things for long periods of time and I'm always going off in twenty different directions at once. But, I believe it is those aspects of my personality which enable my creativity and ingenuity. If my parents, or later on, I myself, chose to medicate those quirks away, what would be left?</p>

<p>Basically another BlackBerry-wielding drone in the machine, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Listen, I'm no revolutionary. I fill out the forms when I have to, and I have "normal" things like bills and household chores and so forth. My life is actually pretty mundane sometimes. Though the point is, I was never medicated or told outright to stop acting a certain way. I figured it out as I went along, and I manage to maintain a semblance of a healthy existence, while still retaining the characteristics which make me who I am. All without the modifying effects of psychotropic medications.</p>

<p>And yes, I'm well aware that just about any substance consumed could be considered a mood-altering substance, but I'm certainly not dependent on any of them. I love my energy drinks but I don't require them to stay ahead. I'll get through the day. Comparing a Red Bull to an Adderall regimen is like comparing a 9mm round to a cluster bomb unit though. Same idea (boom), but a huge degree of difference in said boom.</p>

<p>Plus, beyond the poorly-understood detrimental health effects upon the children of our society caused by these substances, it's coaching society into a habit of medicating our mental quirks away. Already, there's generations of people my age and older who regularly medicate themselves to "stay ahead", and "stay competitive". And these habits are passed down to their children. In the pursuit of the almighty dollar, people drop a panoply of psychotropic medications on a scale to make the ghost of Elvis envious. College students deal in pharmaceuticals just to get that A on the final. Here's a clue on that, hotshot, the answers are usually found rather easily, and cheaper than scoring some of Merck's finest. Yes, I'm saying that you can pay off a TA to get the answer key, pretty much.</p>

<p>Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not condemning modern medicine. If I get shot or otherwise grievously injured, I want the best technology that the medical field can provide to patch me up and make me better. I'm just not so sure we should be medicating away our supposed mental quirks, since it seems that we, as a society, are bent on numbing and erasing the individual features of our psyche that make each and every one of us unique. Do we really all want to be on this statistical norm? Is the goal in life to tap away at Excel spreadsheets all day under the harsh glare of fluorescent lights? The paranoid part of me says that the overmedication of society is conditioning for just that. A pseudo-state of complacency found in pill form. Blissful ignorance, if you will.</p>

<p>Sure, society needs fiends tapping away at Excel and crunching numbers, but you know what? I've met people, whom I consider crazy, who legitimately get off on that sort of thing. Enough that even without medication, there's plenty of people who are motivated by their own personal thrill of solving a complex statistical problem in order to better optimize the interest rate on someone's savings account. There's enough "natural" accountants out there, is what I am getting at. I think we're all capable of harnessing our own mental quirks to our benefit, and neither we, nor our children, need to be doped up on Adderall all the time.</p>

<p>And, it's the crazy ones (yes, I know, I know, we've all seen the old Apple ads...) who are usually moving things forward for us as a society. Einstein wore the same outfit every day. Steve Jobs was a tyrant and yelled at people a lot, Leonardo was borderline anti-social, Van Gogh cut off his own ear. But these people left lasting positive impressions on society. If they had been medicated into submission, where would we be?</p>

<p>The long-term effects, beyond the physical, are that we are merely medicating away the effects of a sick society. We're not getting at the root causes of the pressure to use these medications, we're just merely masking the symptoms.</p>

<p>I'm not here to condemn anyone's use of any drug, legal or otherwise. It's your body, it's your choice. Just consider that you may be snuffing out what makes you unique in this world. I might be a whirlwind of random ramblings and crackpot schemes, but that's what makes me who I am. If I adhere to a statistical norm and toe the party line all the time, there's really no point in me, as a unique individual, in sticking around. And that, my dear small audience, is a fate worse than death.</p>

<p>Footnote: I'm not a medical professional, either. I'm just calling it like I see it.</p>
