<p>One of my pet peeves since moving here ages ago has been the scooter rider.</p>

<p>Now, I recognize the utility of the scooter. It's light, efficient, and you can stow it almost
anywhere when not in use. Plus, you don't need insurance, and LEOs tend to leave you be.</p>

<p>It is probably the last one which makes scooter riders so obnoxious...</p>

<p>Before I acquired my current mode of personal transport, I would either take public transit, or on occasion, have
the use of a friend's scooter. They're fun to ride, and useful for getting around the Beach and the Downtown area.
However, being that there's nothing between you and the road but your clothes, I tended to ride cautiously, knowing that
I'm not as visible as I would be in a car or truck. It was up to me to watch where I was going.</p>

<p>However, most scooter riders do not. They ride like they own the road, and expect other motorists to watch out for them.
Now, realistically, that is fair since they have the lighter and less powerful vehicle. But fair only if they are obeying the
same rules of the road the rest of us try to do. For the most part, scooter riders around here tend to weave in and out of traffic
with abandon, often in packs. You see the 'pack' phenomenon on Memorial Day Weekend, when herds of tourists rent every available
scooter on the Beach and troll Washington Avenue in packs of twenty or more, as if they were some sort of mentally-challenged
chapter of the Hell's Angels.</p>

<p>Worse yet, your average scooter rider will blame you for any of their indiscretions on the road.</p>

<p>Case in point. Yesterday, I was leaving the Publix complex on Fifth and Alton. As I eased on to Lenox Avenue into the flow of traffic,
a kid, dare I say a <em>chmak</em>, on a Vespa was closing in on me rather fast. Now, the light ahead of me was red, so myself and the drivers in front of me clearly could not
move. The scooter rider, rather than stop and join the flow of traffic as he would have been required to do, swerved to the <em>right</em> of me and
the rest of the cars in the lane, choosing to wedge his noisy lawn-mower-sounding contraption between all of us and the sidewalk. My outraged
fellow car drivers honked in protest as he wedged through, only to be met by a stream of incoherent curses and curiously random gestures which
may have passed for obscene in some far-flung nation on the other side of the world. I suppose flailing your arms about and screaming could
be considered an obscene gesture, somewhere. There's a lot of people on this planet. All the while, this kid's conveyance was still in forward
motion.</p>

<p>Someone less kind than me could have taken exception to that, actually. This is Miami, after all. The kid on the Vespa is damn lucky in that
regard.</p>

<p>Scooter riders, scoot all you want, but realize it's a two-way street. You're on a motor vehicle too. It's a scooter, not a Hayabusa.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/skyline-7023_blog.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Downtown Miami'" ></p>

<p>It's been a year since I've gotten back to Miami. I beat to death the <a href="http://dvdigital.tumblr.com/post/9305311687/miami-versus-vegas-since-ive-been-back-people">differences between Miami and Vegas</a>
over on my old Tumblr, so I won't get into it here all over again.</p>

<p>In a nutshell though, absence made the heart grow fonder, and despite the faults of Miami, I'm still glad I came back.</p>

<p>A lot of people rain on Miami's parade at any opportunity. The "lack of culture" and the lack of "real" opportunities outside of the world of
hospitality and tourism usually factor into most people's discussions about the downsides of living in this area.</p>

<p>However, if you look closer, Miami is a very young city. Founded in 1896, it is the oldest municipality in South Florida. The area was settled prior to that, but no real development occurred until then. So, as it were, the city, and the area in general, have a scant 150 years of history to support it. Cultural meccas like Boston and New York have centuries of cultural development. Nonetheless, even with the relative age of our society here, certain things considered "cultural" have definitely taken hold. Gatherings and events like Art Walk and of course the almighty Art Basel Miami exemplify this. Along with our crop of homegrown musical talent, which spans way beyond the stereotypical "Latin" sound. Groups like ArtOfficial and Spam All-Stars are in the global music scene representing the 305, as it were.</p>

<p>Now, on the subject of opportunity. A lot of people bemoan the lack of "real" companies having branches or operations here. The fact is, they do. Most major corporations, ranging from heavyweights like Xerox and Canon, to more specialized outfits like Diageo (liquor) have their Latin American headquarters here. Along the same lines, the major South American banks are headquartered here for reasons of safety and stability, and proximity to their home countries. However, it's the lack of "corporatism" in where Miami can shine. A city like Miami is ripe for the spirit of self-employment and entrepreneurship. Even educated people who choose to locate here, often start their own business in any number of fields, including "Miami typical" ones like hospitality, entertainment, the arts, and music, or even unexpected fields like software development and engineering. I personally know several local talented software developers who work from home or small office spaces on projects that are headquartered around the globe.</p>

<p>It's actually people like these who represent the future of doing things. I see cities like Miami becoming immensely popular as a living location as self-employment and telecommuting become more and more accepted and popular. And why not? Most common tasks in any business environment don't require much more than a computer with an internet connection, with the office space being a mere formality and comforter for employers. Of course, for such things to take hold, a sea change in our attitudes towards work and employment need to happen. I'll leave that for another rant entirely.</p>

<p>However, it's this unconventional environment which drew me here, and drew me back home after my absence. The travel opportunities were fun, but there's definitely no place like home.</p>

<p>Besides, being unconventional is fun.</p>
