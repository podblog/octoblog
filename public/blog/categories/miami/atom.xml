<p>If you really want to get out into where it gets dark, you should probably head north and west along US 27 if you live or are shooting in the metropolitan Miami area...</p>

<p>It's definitely out where the buses don't run.</p>

<p><iframe width="" height="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hIv-YaVBtA8 " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<p>I miss Miami Vice.</p>

<p>You'll see a bit of the old South Florida when you get out that way. Before the sprawl and the overdevelopment.</p>

<p>This image was done with my 50 1.2 L. So far, so good. I'm definitely happy with the purchase. Prime lenses give you that extra five percent in overall image quality, and the 50 doesn't disappoint in this regard.</p>

<p>This is a 30 second exposure from the side of US 27 heading northbound just over the county line into Broward. There was a small amount of moonlight partially obscured by clouds. The rest is all ambient light, including airglow, the distant Miami city lights, and the lights of passing vehicles.</p>

<p>I'm sure the truckers were wondering what I was doing at 1:30 in the morning on the side of the road. Protip, bring a flashlight, and just point it at the ground when vehicles are coming close.</p>

<p>I'll be putting this one up for sale soon at my <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">FAA</a> site.</p>

<p>Even though I think social networking is mainly a lot of hype, snake oil, and the dumbing down of the narcissistic masses even further, I'll gladly admit my addiction to Instagram. At least to do something meaningful with it, you have to overcome the limitations of your iPhone camera, and go for what's there. It's part of the challenge, to me. Plus, I like the UI and the way it sends your photo while you think of some pithy caption, so it almost appears to upload at warp speed.</p>

<p>There's a trend on Instagram, called "Throwback Thursday". Well, it's Thursday right now. So I like to do throwbacks when I can.</p>

<p>I first saw this when I jumped on Instagram a few months ago. People would post photos from their past, and call them "throwbacks". Now, of course, the limit of the throwback is tied to the age of the image that is being posted. And, most images being posted are straight from a digital source. And unless you were in the photo biz, you had no easy way to digitize your old film shots.</p>

<p>When I shot film, I had a film scanner. Not a flatbed to scan prints, which was essentially making second-generation copies, but a full-on "digital enlarger", which actually had 1/3 the resolution of my current digital SLR, oddly enough. It was a Minolta unit, which actually was old when I bought it, and required me to get an equally-old <em>SCSI</em> (remember SCSI?) adapter card for my homebuilt PC to make it work. It was painfully slow. An average photo session from a club took about 3 hours to scan in if I wanted the proper results.</p>

<p>As time went on, I obviously upgraded to digital (in mid-2003 no less!) with a Canon 10D DSLR. I stowed my Minolta scanner, and actually never touched it again. By the time it occurred to me that maybe I'd want a film scanner to bring back some of those old archived images, it was well past the time when I even had a desktop PC with which it could be used. I had migrated to Apple, and obviously my Macbook had only USB and Firewire ports. Yes, I know Nikon, Imacon, and others make USB and Firewire film scanners, but, economies of scale did not touch them, and they were still as expensive and as rare as the days they were a common item in professional photo labs around the world. There were some cheap brand-X scanners on eBay, but the results were disappointing. And I wasn't about to ship my negatives and chromes to New York, just to have them scanned in. No one is asking for the old stuff for any commercial reasons, anyways, i.e. I couldn't warrant a film scanner purchase just for social media use.</p>

<p>Now, I know what is being asked, "Hey, Pod, didn't you save the files you made from the scans?"</p>

<p>Well, actually I only saved the final JPEG files, which in those days I only saved them at 320 px across in the long dimension to fit the specs for CJ. It wasn't worth saving the TIFF files since if I was printing, I would just do it at the pro lab I worked at at the time on their Frontier system or traditional darkroom. And the only reason to go to TIFF was for archival reasons, and if you had the negs and chromes (which I do), you already had an archive. However, that archive might as well be on the moon as far as quickly accessing it is concerned.</p>

<p>That being said, I did a fun trick for the Tiësto image at the start of this article. That one is from 2002. Nick sent me out to this Nettwerk America record label event at the Aqua Hotel on Collins Avenue, to take photos of "this Tiësto guy", while a writer he drafted interviewed him. Hah, the days of real interviews.</p>

<p>Anyways...what I did to get this "digital" was that I made a pure white block on my Macbook Air's monitor, and laid the chrome of Tijs over it. The white light shines through the chrome, making it visible. Then I used my iPhone camera to take a photo of the chrome laid over the white block. Insta-lightbox-low-res-social-media-scanner. And if you want to do a "scan" of a negative, you just do the same thing, export to Photoshop, invert the colors, do some balancing, and you've got yourself a quick and dirty capture of an old analog image. It's not Imacon quality (but then again, what else is?), but to impress all your friends and mindless followers on Instagram, it's definitely sufficient. A step up would be to rig up your DSLR and do it at a higher resolution. However, then you are picking up the individual elements of the screen unless you have a Retina display. At that point you should probably just secure a lightbox from eBay. Hmm, wait...</p>

<p>Since this blog is partially educational, I'm putting this idea out to the community free of charge. All I ask is if you use this technique, just tag your Instagrams with #podscan and @pod_gram. Attribution is always welcome, and it's what people used to do. Your image and caption can be a throwback!</p>

<p>Happy Throwback Thursday.</p>

<p>Well, today was a bit contentious. But in a good way. My prior commentary on the <a href="http://edmsnob.com/">EDM Snob</a> revealing himself generated a fair amount of buzz, and also some direct emails to me. Some agreed with me, some didn't, but the magic was that they went through the trouble to email me and their replies were well-prepared and thought out. Even if you think I'm wrong, I always appreciate a well-crafted message. To quote my friend <a href="http://pingup.com/">Dade</a>, "It's the nuances I appreciate..."</p>

<p>That being said, I'm sure my benign lens review will generate far less controversy and commentary. I spew forth about the de-anonymizing of some guy in the dance music scene and it's game on. I post an educational piece and I get one reply.</p>

<p>Anyways, let's be an agalmic cowboy and balance out the karma bank a bit.</p>

<p>I recently decided to live a little and invest in a 50 1.2 L prime lens from Canon. This is currently the fastest lens that Canon currently produces. With a maximum aperture of 1.2, this lens can practically "see in the dark".</p>

<p>I'm not going to bore you guys with MTF charts and line pairs per mm comparisons. It's been done. This lens has been around for about a decade now, and the scientific reviews have been done and done again. Instead, I'm going to speak about my personal experience with this lens thus far.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lpm-7530.jpg" width="640" height="960" title="'Jordyn 50 1.2 L'" ></p>

<p>I picked it up used from <a href="http://adorama.com/">Adorama</a> for a shade over $1200 US total. Adorama rated the condition as "E+" which basically means it was probably a floor demo or something to that effect. The date code has the construction of this specific copy of the lens of sometime in 2008. Now, according to most photo bloggers, the date code matters little, since typically high-priced pieces of glass sometimes can sit for years before they ship out to retailers, or in fact sit on the shelves of the retailers themselves for awhile. So, even though this copy is almost 5 years old, it arrived looking as fresh as the day Canon made it. Adorama of course inspected it and cleaned it, but you can still tell when a lens has been taken care of. Included was a front and rear cap, and even the lens hood, which is normally a separate item.</p>

<p>The build quality is consistent with the other L-series lenses by Canon. Metal housing and mount, and a great deal of weight. This isn't a light lens by any stretch. The main reason I bought this, other than the fast 1.2 maximum aperture, was the build. Shooting clubs and events can beat up your gear, so I don't like to take chances.</p>

<p>Case in point, a few years ago, I owned the Canon EF-S 17-55 2.8 IS lens. A wonderful piece of glass in it's own right, this was the "L" lens of the EF-S (crop body mount) lenses. However, it didn't have the build quality of a true L lens, and after about a year, the IS mechanism failed on it. Rather than repair it, I sold it to <a href="http://keh.com">KEH</a> and got a credit towards my current ultrawide angle champ, the 16-35 2.8 L, which has served me faithfully for over six years now.</p>

<p>If you shoot in any sort of environment that could be considered "rough", buy your glass accordingly. It might seem strange to pay $1200 for a fixed focal length lens, but the build quality will save you money in the long run.</p>

<p>However, all the build quality in the world matters not, if the lens itself does not perform.</p>

<p>And perform it does.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lpm-7442.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'DJ Louis Puig of Space Miami 50 1.2 L'" ></p>

<p>The color rendition is amazing. Vivid, though accurate, with very little chromatic aberration, which can be fixed in post if it bothers you that much. The sharpness is unrivaled by any other 50mm prime I've tried, whether it be the Canon 50mm 1.4, or any number of third-party primes in that class. L glass is simply in a class of it's own. At it's max aperture of 1.2 your subject is decently sharp. The sweet spot for this piece of glass is from around 2.8 and up to f8 in my experience. This is simply a superb piece of prime glass.</p>

<p>However, shooting with it can be a personal challenge. Unlike it's bulkier, more expensive cousin, the 85mm 1.2 L, the 50 1.2 L has a decent autofocus mechanism. Your AF will land all the time, every time, where you want it. This is dependent on your body though. The 5D MK II I use isn't known for having the best autofocus, but I have my ST-E2 with it's assist beam to help things along. I landed my AF almost every time. Now, with that being said, I was experimenting with shooting at the max aperture of 1.2 a lot of the time.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/roland-7199.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Roland at Gryphon 50 1.2 L'" ></p>

<p>Even at lesser ISOs than 6400, at 1.2 you are letting in a lot of light. Of course the tradeoff is that your depth of field is insanely shallow. Using a handy <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html">depth-of-field</a> calculator, you can see that it is around <em>.07 feet</em> at the distance I took the above photo of Roland at. So, not much to work with. Some not used to this shallow DOF blame the lens. It's not the lens, it's you. It's just real challenging to shoot at that shallow depth of field and land your shot properly. You will need to take multiple images and also, if possible, advise your subject to stay as still as possible. If they move, your composition can be thrown off as your specific focus point can move out of the acceptable area of focus.</p>

<p>Though it is the challenge that makes it fun. While you might have a lot of throwaways at first, after time you will get used to the unique qualities of this amazing lens. I haven't used it consistently enough yet, but now that I own a copy, I know I will get better with it over time. I've already landed quite a few unique images because of this, and I know I will do more as I get acquainted with the properties of this lens. Having the capability to go that shallow with your depth of field can yield some amazing results, whether you are in a nightclub environment, or a controlled daytime situation.</p>

<p>Even with the challenges of shooting with it, I can definitely recommend this lens. You can save a lot of money by buying it's cheaper cousin, the 50 1.4, however, the faster aperture and superb build quality of the 50 1.2 L will make up for the savings over the course of time. L glass is for a lifetime, and investing in it is definitely worth the effort.</p>

I will definitely be posting more examples of what this lens can do as time goes on, including on how this is ideal for video.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/rs-6452.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Space Crowd Again'" ></p>

<p>For the past few months, a blog called <a href="http://edmsnob.com/">EDM Snob</a> was shaking up the dance music world. Written by an anonymous writer, the blog aired the controversies and the dirty laundry of the scam known as the modern dance music scene. It reminded me of TNL, but in blog form.</p>

<p>Today, the writer decided to reveal his real name and location.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Long suspected to be someone 'in the know', the EDM Snob turned out to be one Albert Berdellans, a graduate student living in Miami, with no formal industry involvement whatsoever.</p>

<p>Albert decided to reveal himself after he found out that people suspected of being him were getting into trouble with their employers, up to the point of losing their jobs, even. That took a lot of courage on his part. Well done, Albert. However, it does reveal a few sad facts, some of which Albert noted in his farewell post. The first one, in my mind, is the most telling:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Up until this point, EDM media had been full of what a fellow writer in an email exchange called “breathless boosterism.” In other words, people were only writing positive things about EDM. That’s great, but nothing in this world is perfect. You have to tell the whole story.</p><footer><strong>Albert Berdellans</strong> <cite><a href='http://edmsnob.com/the-end-of-edmsnob/'>The End of EDM Snob</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>This is reminiscent of my post from a week or so ago, <a href="http://www.dan-vidal.com/blog/2012/09/10/the-free-flow-of-opinion/">The Free Flow Of Opinion</a>. He saw the need for the real story to get out, and provided a channel for it. And yes, the modern commercial dance music world is wholly dependent on advertorial. When your entire premise is making overpaid stars out of guys who play back prerecorded sounds in a set pattern, it's easy for anyone with a modicum of knowledge to see that it's a complete scam.</p>

<p>The sad part comes in on how the dance music world reacted to these stories getting out. In their quest to keep the public from seeing the old man behind the curtain, the industry started making examples out of people suspected to be the EDM Snob, or at least feeding him information. As Albert pointed out:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>here have been times over the last few months where people within the industry have been accused of being me. Sometimes there has even been circumstantial evidence that connects them with something I wrote. In some cases, this has cost people their jobs or seriously damaged their careers. I simply cannot continue to stand by and allow other people to be blamed and suffer for the things I write. No one deserves that.</p><footer><strong>Albert Berdellans</strong> <cite><a href='http://edmsnob.com/the-end-of-edmsnob/'>The End of EDM Snob</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Frankly, that's really what stuck with me. The bits and pieces he was revealing, while somewhat controversial, weren't really that damaging. DJs are still getting booked for $100,000 performances. Clubs still fill up on any given night of the week. However, greed and ego overruled everyone's good sense and led to a disappointing backlash from the industry.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this story has led me to wonder about the free flow of information. Is it possible, not just in dance music, but in the world in general, to run a media source dedicated to exposing what really goes on in a given area, without compromising journalistic ethics, or being forced to shut down? The dance music industry couldn't figure out whom Albert was, so they started chopping the heads of suspected informants, hoping to ferret out his identity. I would do the same, since yes, no one deserves that. Especially over something petty like tour schedules and the backstage riders of guys pressing play on CD decks.</p>

<p>Though, at a practical level, it's just dance music and nightlife. The world will move on with or without the Snob. However, it does reinforce my faith in the self-sustaining nature of the forum concept. At TNL we don't out the personal details of members unless they want us to. And, I think we've managed to hammer home with the venues, DJs, and agents that it is user-driven, so going after us is pointless. I learned this lesson in the CJ days oddly enough. This was just after our acquisition, and prior to the days when Track decided to turn the site into pure advertorial. What the circumstances were was that the notorious (now thankfully defunct) venue, Nocturnal, in Downtown Miami, had the first of many run-ins with unpaid creditors and was subject to a law enforcement-backed collection action, which basically means that the repo men roll up with a cop in tow to do their collections work. So, on the night of the collection action, an anonymous source had sent a forum user some grainy cellphone photos of the trucks and police cruiser in front of the venue. I was home at the moment so I posted a story on the front page, in the sense that it was a breaking news item, and also as an experiment in "realtime" blogging (this was 2006...) through our then-new Movable Type blog engine. The story made the rounds over the weekend, until Monday, when I received a threatening call from an attorney whom represented Nocturnal. A little spooked, I pulled the story. A few minutes later, Nick called me on the carpet, not to ask why I had posted it, but why I had taken it down. The essence was that since it was a news item, and it took place in public (the trucks were on a public street and since PD was involved it was public record), it could stay, and the club didn't have a legal leg to stand on. The club played on my then-ignorance of the law, and I pulled the article. Of course, within a few minutes, I reposted it, and ignored all subsequent phone calls from the attorney. It never went further than that, but if it had, any judge would have thrown out the case before it reached trial.</p>

<p>The moral of that tale is that a knowledge of the law is your best friend as a blogger and/or a journalist. While I understand why Albert decided to cease publication of his blog, had he chosen to take it further, he could have had an airtight legal defense, backed in part by the US Constitution. However, it's hard to take this tactic when people's livelihoods and lives are at stake. The dance music community is very tight, and if you lose a gig under bad circumstances in one firm, there is a very real possibility of being blacklisted throughout the industry.</p>

<p>The industry definitely did not fight fair with Albert on this one. They knew they had no legal recourse against him, so they went for the underhanded tactic of sacrificing people's careers, to force him to have an attack of conscience and cease publication. Again, I would have done the same. I applaud Albert though for stating this. By doing so, he went out with a bang, and gave the modern dance music industry a much-deserved punch in the mouth. I guess if you are going to go, go with style. Cheers to that, Albert. By the way, you are more than welcome to post on <a href="http://talknightlife.com/">TNL</a>.</p>

<p>HST really didn't say that, but I think it applies to today's dance music industry. It's sad.</p>

<p>I think I'll put on some old vinyl tonight, and remember when it was just about playing good music and having a great night out.</p>
