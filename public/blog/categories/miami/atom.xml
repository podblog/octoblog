<p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/49508063">• Season 8 Finals - Jive With The Band •</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/dvdigital">Dan V</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>I'm relearning the fine art of video editing. I learned on an analog system (real film!) though the concepts carry over. It's all about the story.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My current weapon of choice for editing is Final Cut Pro X. While the dyed-in-the-wool digital video types give it hell for being too much like iMovie and not a "real" pro product like it was, I find FCP-X suits my fancy for the basic video projects I'm doing myself at the moment. Like I've mentioned in the past, I usually just shoot, and pass my results off to someone with more editing and VFX skills like <a href="http://deepsleepstudio.com/">Alex and his team over at Deepsleep</a>. However, even they use Final Cut Pro X for their final editing workflow.</p>

<p>In the end, an edit is an edit. You're trying to tell a story, and all the VFX goodies and title transitions in the world won't help if your timing and sequencing is off. That's actually something that takes years to master. I know in my head where I want to go with the story, I'm still just learning the modern tools of the trade. So yes, sometimes my edits are "off". It's a work in progress.</p>

<p>You have to think fourth-dimensionally. When shooting and when editing. You have to have an idea of what you want to shoot, and during the edit, what you have in your "bin". In an event like Jive, the regular repeat singers often perform twice throughout the night, once in the beginning, and once near the end to really knock the crowd out. I have to remember that sometimes I'll have "better" footage of say, Sir Diego, from later on in the night, even if his first performance knocked it out of the park. Sometimes it's the reverse actually. Either way, I have to keep in mind I have multiple takes. Keeping the bin coherent is key.</p>

<p>And this is just on the video side. The audio side is a whole other ball of wax. I record with a basic Sennheiser stereo mic, though I do want to progress to one of their wireless kits where I take a feed straight from the FOH mixer at the bar. That is a $600 investment though, and I'm currently not shooting enough live music events to justify the outlay. It's an amazing widget regardless, though.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you are a photographer getting into video, just remember to think fourth-dimensionally. You are composing a project that exists not only in space, but in time.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/12/when-did-the-dj-become-more-important-than-the-crowd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/pete-5312.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Thanks!'" ></p>

<p>A random blog post over at <a href="http://www.faithfanzine.com/?p=1590">Faith Fanzine</a> caught my eye today. One quote from the article summed it up:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>When did we start watching a DJ instead of dancing with our mates , why do we put up with idiotic people taking up the floor who are filming the DJ ,why is the best dance floors now being cut to ribbons to provide extra table space for naff VIP’s ( Pacha in Ibiza hang your head in shame ) ,people with more money than taste and who in some extreme situations in the US have had DJs thrown off the decks because they did not like the music .</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Yes, when did we stop dancing?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>I can't dance, that's a given. I pop around and do monkey moves, get embarrassed, and then I shuffle off to the side. But in the end, I'm still interacting with the crowd and my friends, and squeezing in a few photo ops as I mix and mingle. I take a few (OK a lot in some cases!) photos of the DJ, but I'm not in the middle of the dancefloor gawking at the booth the entire night.</p>

<p>It's actually part of the reason I prefer clubs to the current form of dance music experience, the festival/concert setup.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://seenightlife.com/photos/5595/original_MIA-6086.jpg" width="427" height="640"></p>

<p>In those setups, there is a stage, and a general admission "pit", much like a rock concert. The setup works well for rock concerts, since the whole point of a live musical act performing on stage is so you can see them work their instruments and sing. The act of a DJ mixing, no matter what tools they use, is generally a very passive act, and doesn't lend itself much to a rock-performance aesthetic, no matter how much jumping around and handwaving the DJ is doing. Anything more than that (I'm looking at you, Aoki), smacks of being too contrived and "trying too hard". Essentially the guy playing other people's music in the club has been placed in the center of a stage usually reserved for rockstars. And no matter how many pretty LED screens and image-mapped 3D renderings one throws up there, it comes down to that he's still up there playing back prerecorded sounds in a predetermined sequence. And a lot of DJs in concert situations don't even alter their playlists much from date to date. Zero musical flexibility. Might as well put an iPhone up there and play a prerecorded mix.</p>

<p>Plus, the shows are often at capacity, so there is actually zero room for dancing, and certainly no room for social interaction, since everyone is either focused on the guy pressing play on their laptop, or has their head buried in their phone, stroking their ego on Facebook.</p>

<p>I'm generally regarded as a borderline sociopathic personality. However, I do value social interaction when I'm out for a night of entertainment. It's why I value the few clubs left that actually encourage social discourse and interaction. Venues in town like Space, the Vagabond, and so forth, while they book DJ talent, don't rely on the DJ exclusively to drive their business. Some of my best nights out have been with the local guys on the decks, and I'm just there with my friends, having a good time. Some DJs still get it. <a href="http://seenightlife.com/users/pod/albums/pete-tong-at-space">Pete Tong</a> is a great example. This past weekend, he took to the decks at Space. No grandstanding, no tricks, he just played a great soundtrack to a night/morning out, and the crowd responded in kind. People were dancing, socializing, and having a good time, but not buried in their phones or gawking at the booth for hours on end. So there's hope...</p>

<p>Let's save the rockstar setup for the rockstars.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/artwalk.jpg" width="960" height="960" title="'Artwalk Wynwood Artwalk Miami'" ></p>

<p>Though I guess I could be considered part of the Miami art community, I almost never go to Artwalk in Wynwood. I'm usually busy Saturday nights, or I consider my rare downtime more valuable than bouncing from gallery to gallery, most of which probably wouldn't exhibit anything I do. Photography is sort of underrepresented at Artwalk, but that's for another rant.</p>

<p>So anyways, the rare times I go to it are last-minute call-ups like I did earlier tonight.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I got a text from my good friend <strong>Emi Guerra</strong>, he wanted to go out and cruise Artwalk and meet some of the Miami art community to tell them about his forthcoming <strong>UR1 Festival</strong>, the big music and art festival taking place on December 8th and 9th during Art Basel. The big announcement of the lineup is Monday, even though it has been leaked. So I won't post it here since you can find it <a href="http://forum.talknightlife.com/">elsewhere.</a>.</p>

<p>But anyways, he wanted to go out and see the artists and art people. Makes sense if you are throwing an art-oriented festival. And, since I'm kinda in touch with these people (am I?) he invited me along.</p>

<p>So, I jumped into the 210 and zipped on down Biscayne to Wynwood.</p>

<p>Once I got to the area, what a bloody mission. Traffic was at a gridlocked standstill, and there were throngs of people out and about, to the point where Northwest 2nd Avenue was a pedestrian thoroughfare. I was supposed to meet Emi and his UR1 team at Wynwood Walls, and I ended up having to park about seven blocks away. I'm a healthy boy now so it's no big deal, but it's the principle. And I will not valet. The 210 isn't an SLS or an E 63, but it's my baby and no one except me and the crew at <a href="http://masterclassauto.com/">Masterclass Auto</a> touches the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Some have called for the major streets of Wynwood to be closed off to automotive traffic during Artwalk. 100 percent, yes. Please. Do this. Commissioner Sarnoff, it's your district (for now), make it happen. The cops have their hands full pushing vehicular and pedestrian traffic around, and it's a complete cluster down there, and it actually hampers the enjoyment of Artwalk.</p>

<p>So yes, Artwalk has truly exploded into a Miami social phenomenon. We officially have an art scene here as far as I'm concerned. Go us.</p>

<p>However, I finally did get situated, and met Emi, along with UR1's Jackie Richie, Emi's assistant Andrea, Alex Martinez of <a href="http://deepsleepstudio.com">Deepsleep</a>, and a few other scene people I know at Wynwood Walls, which was "at capacty" and had this weird dining area with a velvet rope and such set up.</p>

<p>They gotta update the artwork there. It's been the same since I last went to Artwalk (oddly enough with Emi's brother, Eddy) over two years ago. I'll paint a wall. It won't be anything "arty", but it will be something from my mind. I'll mention it here even.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, everyone was out in force. Now, was everyone into the art? Hardly. Most people "Artwalking" couldn't tell you if that was a piece by Nagelbett or Britto. They are out for the social experience. Emi phrased it best when he said, "They are out for something to do, and it's cheap to go to Artwalk. Shit is expensive these days..."</p>

<p>He hit the nail on the head. Shit is expensive these days. Dinner for two will run you $100 or more. A night out at a club, even Space, will run you $100 per person (drinks, cover, and so on) or more if you VIP it. Having fun costs money!</p>

<p>But not at Artwalk. The galleries often have cash bars and/or free (albeit low-quality) booze on hand. They usually arrange a sponsorship or something. And the food trucks are out in force, and the food is cheap, though I wouldn't necessarily trust it. Yeah, the modern food trucks have all the amenities, but it's still a food truck, ya know? We called 'em the "roach coaches" back in Jersey. Note to food truck owners, I'm not saying that your food truck has roaches. If you're that concerned about what I said, you probably have something to hide. Be confident in your product and people talking shit, like me, won't affect your business. Let freedom ring.</p>

<p>But yes, anyways, people are out for Artwalk because it's cheap, interesting, and there's a good social dynamic. And the galleries and artists put up with it since it will get their works exposed to the five percent of the people who actually know their art and are in a position to do something about it.</p>

<p>And yes, please block off the streets. Artwalk is now truly a "phenomenon" and it needs to be handled properly. Our art scene is finally getting some worldwide respect, and it'd be a shame if logistical squabbles killed off a major component of it.</p>

<p>Maybe I should run for the City Commission and make Artwalk one of my campaign platforms...</p>

<p>Sidebar: Yes, I'm aware the issues mentioned here are old. But these first few articles on my blog are kind of for SEO purposes, as well as stuff that is on my mind, regardless of when it happened. It's my blog, after all.</p>

<p>Sidebar 2: Yes, this devolved into a rant. In a nutshell, I did have fun at Artwalk. The food truck area is a great concept. Get 'em all in one place. Also, good seeing the <a href="http://car2go.com/">Miami Car2Go</a> people out...thanks for the T-shirt guys.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/210hella960.jpg" width="960" height="360" title="'210 Hella'" ></p>

<p>I took my E320 "the 210" in for some service at the excellent locally-owned repair shop, <a href="http://masterclassauto.com/">Masterclass Automotive</a> this morning. I got the headlamp lenses swapped for spanking new Hellas and some odd DTC codes diagnosed.</p>

<p>A year or so ago, I didn't know what a DTC code was and I sure as hell didn't care. Am I becoming a 'car guy'?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>Those who have known me for more than a few months know, that for the longest time, I was a dedicated bus rider/taxicab user. I had a monthly Metropass (superseded by the Easy Card) for over ten years. Not out of any sense of financial restriction (well OK at some points of time, yes...), but more out of a sense of convenience.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/thebus.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'The Bus'" ></p>

<p>However, during my temporary exile to Vegas, I was pretty much forced into getting a personal vehicle. Vegas has public transport, but it only covered about 30 percent of the valley, and even then only during daytime hours. Forget about nighttime buses.</p>

<p>At first, AMG was kind enough to provide me with a rental for the times I was actually on the ground in Vegas. It was a serviceable Ford Focus, and did the job as it were. But spending $2K+ a month to give me wheels didn't quite fit their budget, so after my Tiësto tour gig and prior to me running out the lease in Vegas, I had to acquire my own vehicle. A few options presented themselves, most notably of which was the vehicle I now own, the Mercedes E320.</p>

<p>Now, not being a car expert as it were, I had to call on some assistance to evaluate the purchase. So, I called on a friend of mine out there who owned a shop, to help me evaluate the Benz. In not so many words, it turned out to be a gem. It ran stable and was a good performer for the price, and he left it at "If you don't buy it, I will...". So, sold! I was suddenly a Mercedes owner.</p>

<p>However, as it is an older vehicle, I was advised to get it serviced and any minor repairs dealt with. I guess this is where my inherent geekiness kicked in. Whenever I purchase a new device, be it a camera, lens, phone, laptop, hard drive, or whatever, I research the hell out of it. I look for the obvious pros and cons, and also any tweaks, upgrades, hacks, and tricks to getting the most out of the device.</p>

<p>But, I guess I never considered a car as being a "device". Suddenly, this whole new world opened up to me. DTC codes, OBD-II ports, chassis numbers, ECU patches and upgrades, tire ratings, curb weights, bus voltages, optimal ranges for RPMs, fuel efficiency, horsepower, etc. It was like dissecting a computer component but there's moving parts and physics to call into account too. I guess I got hooked. And, from a pure tech perspective, it's great. I actually enjoy the research and the challenge of keeping the W210 up to spec and beyond.</p>

<p>Sidebar: Mercedes, like other manufacturers, typically assigns chassis numbers to certain classes of vehicles. For example, the W210 chassis encompasses the model years 1998-2002 and specifically the E320, E430, E300 turbodiesel, E55 AMG, and a few other models. Most enthusiasts of the brand refer to their cars by the chassis number in addition to the model number. Total geek thing.</p>

<p>But anyways, I guess my inherent need to break something down into it's components and see how it all works comes into play. I found out that the headlamp lenses could be replaced, for example. And yes, the more you know, the more you can save by doing things yourself or getting a good lead on what the mechanic will be doing. Each headlamp lens I had swapped in this morning was $85.00 as opposed to $300.00 for the entire housing if I just went with a dealer.</p>

<p>I also actually plan on getting an OBD-II dongle which interfaces with my iPhone. More stats and numbers to obsess over.</p>

<p>And I guess somewhere along the way I started becoming a "car guy". It's a fun diversion.</p>

<p>Now, of course I'm smart about it. I really only drive when I have to, and I still avail myself of public options when it's convenient or safe to do so, hence my retaining of my Easy Card and having a Car 2 Go membership. Keeping those options around (I switched my Easy Card to "refill when needed") doesn't cost any money unless you use it, so it's nice to have a "B" and "C" option, and a "too cheap to ride a cab and am going out for a drink or five" option too.</p>

<p>So, some of the "old Pod" still remains. Go figure.</p>

    <link href="http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/08/28/so-much-for-isaac/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/isaacgram.jpg" width="612" height="612" title="'Isaac Weekend'" ></p>

<p>I think this past weekend was a good example of what I've heard some people refer to as a "South Florida Snow Day"...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As I alluded to in the last post, Tropical Storm (and potential future hurricane) Isaac popped up on the South Florida cultural radar this past week. The usual cautionary tales ensued, with speculation turning to preparation on Thursday and Friday. Friday, the rain started to show up, with Saturday becoming a complete washout.</p>

<p>By Saturday night though, it appeared Isaac would only be a low-grade tropical storm, and the worst of it was to miss South Florida entirely, and veer through the Keys and out into the Gulf. But, the machinery of closures was already in motion. It definitely reminded me of the snow days growing up...</p>

<p>I grew up in the Northeast. As such, we had snow days when I was in school. If a storm happened, often the roads would be rendered dangerous, and as we were a walking/drive-your-kids-to-and-from-school district (only the special needs kids got buses), it was considered a liability to have kids out and about going to and from school in the event of a snow emergency. So, early in the morning of the day of the storm, the powers that be over at the school district HQ, would decide to declare a snow day, or not. They sometimes erred on the side of caution, choosing to close the district even if the accumulation wasn't that bad. So, there'd be three inches of snow on the ground (a laughable amount), and school would be closed.</p>

<p>Much like yesterday (Monday) with regards to Isaac. I woke up Monday morning, and was surprised to see the sun was out. However, the day prior, Sunday, was a complete rain event, as they say, and the governments and major businesses had already called off their Monday operations. I guess in the case of government, it's hard to recall a shutdown. However, it did rain a lot Monday afternoon, and I think it was a much-needed day off for a lot of people, personally. Though with remote work capabilities and telecommuting, the economy probably didn't suffer too much.</p>

<p>I think it was as close to a perfect situation in terms of disruption as you can get though. Enough rain came around to cause government and big business to shut down, but not so much as to engender widespread devastation and chaos. In practical matters, people got time off, and South Florida's party machine kicked into action over the weekend. It was "slow", of course, but most bars and nightclubs had enough business to justify staying open. I wonder what that says for society when we'll go through hell and high water to get drunk? Probably that we spend too much time at work, personally. But, that's another blog rant.</p>

<p>The party machine around was definitely active, with the events I attended at Chalk on South Beach, and of course Space in Downtown Miami, being heavily attended.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/classics-3797.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Space Classics'" ></p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/fuji-3505.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Chalk'" ></p>

<p>I've been through a few rain events and hurricanes, and despite the threat of damage and destruction, I've always kind of liked the atmosphere at hurricane parties. Plus, nothing beats exiting a venue and realizing, rather dimly, that you probably should get home and see about getting things situated in case the storm really does come. I remember when Hurricane Wilma, the last storm of any significance to come through South Florida directly, came through in October of 2005. I was living on Normandy Isle in the northern part of Miami Beach at the time in a fairly rattletrap (Sorry Su, it's true...but we had fun!) apartment building, and I got around via public transport or taxis. I had shot an event with Sander Kleinenberg at Space earlier, and made my usual late exit from the venue that Sunday morning. Of course, I had heard reports that this pesky storm might just come for us, but didn't give it much thought. I had gotten home, checked a few reports, most of which centered on "Yes, it's coming for Miami, but at what strength we don't know...", and passed out to sleep. I woke up about eight hours later to the sounds of my roommate and his friend stocking up for the storm. Apparently it was close, as we lost power a few hours later. Fortunately we had enough random provisions to get through the next few days, but for a minute it was kind of tense as we had no "real" food.</p>

<p>I'm a little more responsible nowadays, I think. I have a few gallons of water on hand and a FIVESTAR account with hotels.com. And I keep an eye on my iPhone during potential hurricane periods. If things look ugly, I'll prebook a hotel inland and north and get out of town. Might not be the most entertaining course of action, but fortunately I'm mobile. I can fit everything important to me (gear, data, and some clothes) into my trunk. And if the storm is a non-event, I can come back home.</p>

<p>It might not work for you though. Don't blame me if it doesn't.</p>
