<p>Well, it appears I survived the holiday weekend. I'm not one for Black Friday shopping or massive crowds, so I spent Friday itself laying low. I wanted to get out there and "produce" rather than consume, but, nothing major came out of my drivetime adventures either on Friday or Sunday. Which begs the question, can the creative process be forced?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I'm not necessarily talking about paid assignments or tasks, either. When you have a specific framework or set of requirements in mind, it's easy. Take a photo of Bayfront Park for a brochure. We need stock photos of police cruisers lined up. We need a photo of a dog destroying a rug. However, when I set out with a task in mind, such as capturing a nighttime landscape image, occasionally it does lead to a lot of driving around with nothing to show for it. But then, when I least expect it, I'll "land" a great image that I'm proud to show around.</p>

<p>It kind of happened this weekend. I drove around Friday, and Sunday, and didn't generate much in the way of what I considered quality photographic content. Perhaps it was holiday malaise, the phases of the moon, I couldn't really put my finger on it.</p>

<p><p><a href='/blog/2012/11/25//' data-instagram-url='http://instagr.am/p/SeSwHmAgLd/' class='instagram-image'><img src='http://distilleryimage9.s3.amazonaws.com/a6f73fc6376311e2b2f422000a9f1255_7.jpg' alt='Doing something civil #broward #drivetime #954' height='612' width='612' /></a><br/>Filtered with <a href='/blog/categories/normal'>Normal</a> through <a href='/blog/categories/instagram'>Instagram</a></p><!--more--><p><a href='http://maps.google.com?q=26.021867551,-80.11507505'><img border='0' src='http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=26.021867551,-80.11507505&markers=26.021867551,-80.11507505&zoom=14&size=612x200&sensor=false' alt='Hollywood Beach Garfield Park' /></a><br/>Taken at Hollywood Beach Garfield Park</p><p class='instagram-comment-holder'><a href='https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=082223ce4af44db2a4b0440fd98957c9&redirect_uri=http://www.dan-vidal.com/#access_token=31120127.082223c.33c03a5584f54c3494027e191a8d7b73&response_type=token&scope=likes+comments' id='332785893997937373_31120127' class='instagram-comment-link'>Sign in with Instagram to view Likes and Comments</a></p></p>

<p>Though I did enjoy the exercise at least.</p>

<p>However, in my Saturday club travels, I landed two images which I personally consider presentable material. The first was of Jordyn at Space, as seen above, and the second was of my friend Jane, over at the Vagabond, where I stopped in for <a href="http://djoscarg.net/">Oscar G's</a> and Ralph Falcon's birthday party. Murk boys in effect.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/jane-7808.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Hi Jane'" ></p>

<p>Both images, are obviously "club" images. One of my fort√©s happens to be nightlife photography, obviously, but as of late, I've been trying to expand my horizons and get away from the familiar pattern of colorfully-lit dancing girls, DJs, fog effects, and crowds. It's fun and I really enjoy it, but I have been trying to expand my repertoire a little bit, i.e. with my landscapes and scenic nighttime photography.</p>

<p>Which begs the question, can the creative process be forced? My two "score" images were generated off-the-cuff, with little technical thought to them. Lights are at <em>x</em>, so shutter speed at <em>y</em>, aperture at <em>z</em>, and ISO at <em>alpha</em>, and press the shutter button. The one of Jane actually had a little more thought to it since I saw the light on the wall and had to position her accordingly, but it wasn't a "planned" image in the sense that I spent time driving around and looking for it. Ms Jane wanted an image, and I gladly provided.</p>

<p>So maybe sometimes "don't think, just shoot" can lead to results as well. I'm definitely digging the end results. Even in the familiar territory of nightlife, I can still pull off a unique composition. And the process wasn't forced. I "had a vision and waited for the world to fall in line...". Maybe trying to force the world to fall in line doesn't work?</p>

<p>And of course having willing subjects helps enormously. Thanks to Jane, and Jordyn as well for participating in my lens antics this weekend.</p>

<p>This past weekend, The Martinez Brothers took to the decks at Space. They've got the youthful energy and enthusiasm in spades. Playing for well over ten hours, they kept the dancefloor moving until the afternoon...</p>

<p>I'm not ancient, by any measure, but by the time I left at 9, I was completely drained...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And the kids were still rocking it like they just woke up...</p>

<p>Objectively, I'm actually healthier than I've been in a long time. I try to eat right, and take care of myself. I still have a drink or five when I'm at the club (no one trusts you if you are without a drink in a nightclub...just nod and agree with me on this one) and I will be smart and pace myself. However, sometimes I'm just completely drained, even going into Monday. Is it all mental? Or has a decade and change in-scene finally started to catch up with me?</p>

<p>When I was The Brothers' age, I could do a 9-10 hour "shift" standing on my head, and still bounce back for whatever I had to do on Monday. I could even go out multiple nights a week till 5 AM. Now, I don't go to a club unless there's decent money involved. I'd rather relax with friends or just stay home and read/write/edit. Or go out and shoot scenics.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/bayfront-6921.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The Challenger Monument'" ></p>

<p>Maybe I am "getting old", who knows? I still enjoy the nightlife, but yeah, it does take a lot out of you, regardless of your health.</p>

<p>For my younger readers - this will happen to you. I can guarantee it. Trick is, pace yourself, but even then...</p>

<p>Maybe a vacation is in order.</p>

<p>One of my favorite DJ/Producers, <a href="http://www.djmarkknight.com/">Mark Knight</a>, stopped in at Space this past weekend for a little eight-hour set on the decks. He's got the idea of being a DJ down pat. He mixes in his own material and edits, with a good dose of anything that will make the crowd move. Throughout the night I heard everything from classic Underworld to even an INXS-inspired white label track. And he's always down for a wacky photo or two, like the one above. And, of course, I get asked 'how did I do that'?</p>

<p>In this case, it wasn't just a random happenstance of the lighting and the photo coming together...</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You have a vision and you wait for the world to fall in line and then you capture it...</p><footer><strong>Adriana D</strong> <cite>A Phone Conversation 12 October 2012</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Generally that is how I work. I wait for things to happen, as I've explained before, then I document it. However, in club life, an interesting 'counter' to my little tagline happens, in that the friendly local lighting techs will set up a specific cue, so I can capture the moment. So, I have to wonder, am I waiting for the world to fall in line if someone kind of knows what I would like to see?</p>

<p>I do appreciate the help, obviously, and it is actually not a hard feat for anyone to accomplish if they are out shooting nightlife. The trick here is, to get to know your light techs and the equipment they employ on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>When I first got started in this, I used to be a part-time light tech for my friend John's sound company. John and I, at the time, were both students over at UM, and to make ends meet, and also for the learning experience (his major was audio engineering), John ran a small sound and lighting company on the side. And I was his unofficial-official light tech, due to my experience with lighting in general, and also no one else in our crew knew the concepts. We didn't get paid much, but at the time, half the fun was just being able to get out there and do shows. We mostly did rock shows, but we also did a few dance-oriented events here and there. Nonetheless, I got to learn the basics of stage and nightclub lighting. As time went on, even after John moved back to Aspen to kick off his <a href="http://alchemyavcs.com/">massive production company</a>, I would stay current and always converse and on occasion, fill in as a tech for a lot of the local guys when they were sick, away or "otherwise indisposed". At this time (early to mid 2000s), lighting was moving from a "dedicated console" world, to a PC-driven sort of affair, especially in the nightclub industry. A $300 PC and $700 USB-DMX widget could take the place of a $20000 console in a nightclub setting. The most popular product was <a href="http://martinpro.com/product/product.asp?product=lightjockey">LightJockey</a> by Martin. In a nutshell, after you installed and connected all your fixtures, you used this piece of software and supplied USB-DMX widget, and could program and control your lightshow from any commodity PC. It is all very graphical.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/LJ.jpg" width="600" height="474" title="'Lightjockey 2.0'" ></p>

<p>There's several competing software packages out there nowadays, but Lightjockey is the most common one. The concepts are the same though.</p>

<p>And then, obviously, beyond the controller, is the entire world of the lighting fixtures themselves. Common manufacturers include <a href="http://martinpro.com/">Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.highend.com/">Highend</a>, <a href="http://www.elationlighting.com/">Elation</a>, <a href="http://claypaky.com/">Clay Paky</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>Entire blogs and sites are devoted to lighting. Obviously this one isn't. But, you don't have to be a light tech to speak the basics. The key, I've found, is to know what the fixtures are (spots, washes, scanners, strobes - all kind of self-explanatory), and the right terms for what the fixtures do (If you say 'CTO' you'll usually be taken a little bit more seriously) and what the colors and filters are, and also the basics of how a lighting scene is constructed. Also, if you don't know the tech, get to know him or her (yes, her - one of the best in the biz <a href="https://www.facebook.com/miss.allegra"> is a girl</a>.) and develop a rapport. If it's early in the night, the tech is usually just running through the motions, and will probably be up for a break in the routine. Use the opening DJ as a "practice target", and get some cues set up for yourself.</p>

<p>Now, this all kind of reeks of cheating. And, maybe it is. However, the way I can ethically justify it is now, in a lot of places, the tech will actually bring up "my" cues, without me even asking. At Space, I don't think I've asked Dennis or Gabriel for a specific cue in months. It just all falls into place. They know what will make for a great image, and more importantly, when to deploy those cues, for maximum effect on both the crowd and my image capture. We work together on it.</p>

<p>Plus, a good tech will know the flow and rhythm to the music and crowd, and having specific cues becomes less and less necessary, since the lighting will just happen. When a song peaks, you know there will be a sizable amount of strobing, for example. Or when there is a lull in the track, it could go dark, or a nice blue wash from the Platinum Beams will kick in.</p>

<p>Of course, the assumption being made here is that you are shooting in a venue that is equipped with a decent lighting rig, and, beyond that, a dedicated lighting technician. Some smaller venues still run their lighting systems on autopilot, or according to a preset schedule (Lightjockey allows for scheduled cues based on the time of day, even), depending on the needs of the venue. That being said, most places of that nature actually have a lot of practical lighting, or a good dose of ambient light. There's a lot of light out there if you know where to find it.</p>

<p>But, if the situation allows for it, definitely get to know and work with the light techs in a venue, the resultant images will be much more "meaningful" than your usual run-of-the-mill flash-and-dash captures.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/blog-5407.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'OCP'" ></p>

<p>This morning, when I woke up, a post on Facebook by <a href="http://helloimscott.com/">Scott Alexander</a> caught my eye.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>A good article for photographers and artists of any medium, really. While you're on Edin's site reading this, I highly recommend checking out the rest of his site. Great photographer with a superb eye.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Scott Alexander</strong> <cite>A Facebook Post</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The post linked to <a href="http://www.edinchavez.com/blog/why-should-i-start-a-blog/">an article by local photographer Edin Chavez</a>, on why a photographer should have a blog. The reasons are pretty obvious, ranging from showcasing your work to SEO, and, most importantly, <em>control</em>.</p>

<p>Now, maybe it sounds a little obsessive, but at the end of the day, having a slice of web property you control from top to bottom is important, especially if you are in the creative field. And, unfortunately, there's quite a large amount of creative types who don't have a web property that they explicitly have ownership of. I know more than a few working photographers who only use social media to showcase their works, for example. This can be dangerous.</p>

<p>I'm a "social media sceptic". I've been on the internet in one way or another since 1992, around the time the World Wide Web was born. And yes, there was an <a href="http://www.dan-vidal.com/blog/2012/08/22/how-it-was/">internet before then</a>. My dad was/is a network engineer, so we always had some form of basic online access. In general, we passed on the walled-garden online services of the day like AOL, Compu$erve, and so on. I actually preferred local dialup BBSes, which, in a way, were primitive social networks.</p>

<p>You could post up content, chat with other users, and transfer files around. It was basically a text-mode Facebook, if you think about it. However, after a few years, the era of the BBS faded, replaced by easy internet access and the rise of consumer usage of the WWW. Once people got situated and used to "dot com", soon after came the rise of user-provided content, i.e. the first blogs. Blogging was around before the term was coined (a lot of personal websites had a running journal of the owner's thoughts...), but with the advent of primitive <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">CMS</a> systems, publishing content became a trivial point and shoot exercise. Then, of course, that was extended into social networking as we know it. Friendster kicked off the craze, then MySpace, then proceeding on to Twitter and Facebook, with of course Google constantly on the move to be "the" internet.</p>

<p>However, through all those trends and sea changes, the ability to host and publish your own content on your own web property has remained. I know a few "social media managers" (the title is largely meaningless), and their biggest challenge is keeping up with the trends in services and platforms. Today it is Facebook, tomorrow it could (hopefully) be <a href="http://join.app.net/">app.net</a>, or a move to the <a href="https://joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora</a> model of community-run distributed social networking. Nonetheless, it's a lot to digest and keep up with. It's the nature of the beast, as it were.</p>

<p>And therein lies the problem. I see a lot of people who rely and base their businesses on a specific form of social media. A few years ago, I knew people who made businesses based on doing MySpace profile templates, and they acted as if it was their gateway to untold riches. Now, you have companies building applications around Facebook, acting in much the same way. With the cyclical trendy nature of social media, most of these companies are destined to fail, or disappear, due to their reliance on someone else's platform for their business. It's akin to relying on General Motors cars exclusively for your delivery business, rather than any operational vehicle.</p>

<p>Now, one could drive themselves crazy keeping up with these social media trends. Every so often, you have to convert and repost your content. One bulwark against that, (to bring it all home!), is having your own web property. Now, <a href="http://www.edinchavez.com/blog/why-should-i-start-a-blog/">Edin espouses Wordpress and/or Blogger</a> as a publishing platform, and I of course champion <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>, but that battle is more of a technical one than a political one.</p>

<p>The key is, hosting your content on your own systems, and using social media to drive people to those systems. I know with Octopress it will be a trivial matter to write a plug-in to support broadcasting to any future social network, due to it's open-source nature. And even though Wordpress is rather closed in comparison, some enterprising developer will link WP with whichever future social network becomes ascendent. But, at the end of the day, with having your own domain, own hosting, and own content, one can make themselves immune from the often-flaky, trendy, and chaotic world of social media.</p>
