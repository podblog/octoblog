<p>It's the first week of December, and the Miami edition of Art Basel is in full swing. The official sister festival to the world-famous Art Basel that takes place in (duh!)Basel, Switzerland, Art Basel Miami (that's a lot of Basels in a row, sorry grammarians!) is currently in it's tenth year of operation. It's done wonders for the standing of Miami's art world, but like anything Miami-related, there's a huge layer of bullshit built in...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>As a note of clarification, what most people consider "Art Basel" actually consists of the official <a href="http://artbasel.com/">Art Basel</a> fair at the Miami Beach Convention Center, along with several unrelated satellite fairs such as Design Miami, and the numerous galleries in the Design District and Wynwood neighborhoods in the City of Miami hosting their own affairs. Art Basel Miami basically spawned a whole ecosystem of unaffiliated satellite events, much like Winter Music Conference did. However, unlike WMC, Art Basel is not fighting a rearguard action (sorry Bill, it's true...) with regards to these events. Art Basel basically ignores them and does what they want.</p>

<p>However, most people don't distinguish the individual events per se and just say "Art Basel".</p>

<p>This year, 2012, has proven to be the biggest Basel yet. It's Friday night and I've already noticed a huge amount of traffic on all the Beach-bound bridges and causeways, and the Wynwood neighborhood is a complete traffic disaster. One would guess that after ten years of practice, the various municipalities would have managing this down to a science. At least close the streets to vehicle traffic in Wynwood.</p>

<p><p><a href='/blog/2012/12/05//' data-instagram-url='http://instagr.am/p/S3xzCpggF2/' class='instagram-image'><img src='http://distilleryimage6.s3.amazonaws.com/acbccdda3f2a11e2b12d22000a9e295b_7.jpg' alt='Arty. #artbasel #305 #igersmiami #instagood #miami #wynwood' height='612' width='612' /></a><br/>Filtered with <a href='/blog/categories/normal'>Normal</a> through <a href='/blog/categories/instagram'>Instagram</a></p><!--more--><p><a href='http://maps.google.com?q=25.810598384,-80.19685341'><img border='0' src='http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=25.810598384,-80.19685341&markers=25.810598384,-80.19685341&zoom=14&size=612x200&sensor=false' alt='LMNT Gallery' /></a><br/>Taken at LMNT Gallery</p><p class='instagram-comment-holder'><a href='https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=082223ce4af44db2a4b0440fd98957c9&redirect_uri=http://www.dan-vidal.com/#access_token=31120127.082223c.33c03a5584f54c3494027e191a8d7b73&response_type=token&scope=likes+comments' id='339959308705988982_31120127' class='instagram-comment-link'>Sign in with Instagram to view Likes and Comments</a></p></p>

<p>And the source of that traffic is the crowds, of course. Most of which have no real interest or idea about the art on display, or the art world in general. For the record, I'm not a huge participant in the Miami art scene, even though I've sold a few pieces. I should get out more, to be blunt. However, it isn't too difficult to see that you have the masses of people who are just out for the see-and-be-seen scene, and of course the copious amounts of free booze. Then they can tweet to their friends that they are "Baseling", of course.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/baseling.png" width="322" height="446" title="'Twitter-Baseling'" ></p>

<p>I don't decry anyone making a lifestyle of it, I know several people whose social scene in general consists of cruising sponsored events, but for the art scene in particular, it can be problematic. Artists local and global have to deal with the "freeloaders" in order to get to the 2 percent of the people who may want to purchase their art. The official Art Basel fair actually recognizes this issue and the first two days of the fair are closed to the public and only accessible to well-heeled collectors who can afford a ticket or have the industry cred (i.e. they own a gallery, etc...) to actually be there to conduct business...</p>

<p>But the unfortunate side effect, the bullshit, is that the art generally plays second-fiddle to the social scene. The art is the excuse to go out and get banged up. Hey, if I want to get banged up, I can do that with little to no justification. I do feel though for the local Miami artists, who have to deal with this extraordinary amount of bullshit just to get their work out there. Miami struggles to be recognized as an "arts" city, and when Basel comes, it's all laid bare that 90 percent of the crowd is just treating it as a hipster version of Spring Break in December. With celebrities, who actually don't purchase any of the art, anywhere.</p>

<p>I feel for friends of mine, like KEPROCK, whose work is Instagrammed above, who struggle to produce great pieces, and they have to struggle further just to get heard.</p>

<p>Have I voluntarily recused myself from Basel? As a potential exhibitor? Yes. I've had "real life" happening, and haven't had the time to curate and produce my own exhibit. However, discussions have happened. I'm hoping to do something next year.</p>

<p>As someone going out to check out the scene? No. I've been out, just bouncing around basically. I've avoided the big-ticket fairs, the celebrity events, and the Beachside quagmire. I have scant desire to be crammed into any venue which is flush with people doing Instagram self-portraits (har har) and checking in so all their friends get to see how 'cultured' they are. So far I've done a few Wynwood runs, ended up at <a href="http://www.thecornermiami.com/">The Corner</a> three times in one night, and somehow ended up at the Vagabond. Oddly enough in these travels, I've seen more genuine art-related goings on than in any "art" themed event.</p>

<p>If you are here for Basel, welcome. Just don't bullshit a bullshitter, and be honest. You're only here for the (free) beer.</p>

<p>Well, it appears I survived the holiday weekend. I'm not one for Black Friday shopping or massive crowds, so I spent Friday itself laying low. I wanted to get out there and "produce" rather than consume, but, nothing major came out of my drivetime adventures either on Friday or Sunday. Which begs the question, can the creative process be forced?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I'm not necessarily talking about paid assignments or tasks, either. When you have a specific framework or set of requirements in mind, it's easy. Take a photo of Bayfront Park for a brochure. We need stock photos of police cruisers lined up. We need a photo of a dog destroying a rug. However, when I set out with a task in mind, such as capturing a nighttime landscape image, occasionally it does lead to a lot of driving around with nothing to show for it. But then, when I least expect it, I'll "land" a great image that I'm proud to show around.</p>

<p>It kind of happened this weekend. I drove around Friday, and Sunday, and didn't generate much in the way of what I considered quality photographic content. Perhaps it was holiday malaise, the phases of the moon, I couldn't really put my finger on it.</p>

<p><p><a href='/blog/2012/11/25//' data-instagram-url='http://instagr.am/p/SeSwHmAgLd/' class='instagram-image'><img src='http://distilleryimage9.s3.amazonaws.com/a6f73fc6376311e2b2f422000a9f1255_7.jpg' alt='Doing something civil #broward #drivetime #954' height='612' width='612' /></a><br/>Filtered with <a href='/blog/categories/normal'>Normal</a> through <a href='/blog/categories/instagram'>Instagram</a></p><!--more--><p><a href='http://maps.google.com?q=26.021867551,-80.11507505'><img border='0' src='http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=26.021867551,-80.11507505&markers=26.021867551,-80.11507505&zoom=14&size=612x200&sensor=false' alt='Hollywood Beach Garfield Park' /></a><br/>Taken at Hollywood Beach Garfield Park</p><p class='instagram-comment-holder'><a href='https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=082223ce4af44db2a4b0440fd98957c9&redirect_uri=http://www.dan-vidal.com/#access_token=31120127.082223c.33c03a5584f54c3494027e191a8d7b73&response_type=token&scope=likes+comments' id='332785893997937373_31120127' class='instagram-comment-link'>Sign in with Instagram to view Likes and Comments</a></p></p>

<p>Though I did enjoy the exercise at least.</p>

<p>However, in my Saturday club travels, I landed two images which I personally consider presentable material. The first was of Jordyn at Space, as seen above, and the second was of my friend Jane, over at the Vagabond, where I stopped in for <a href="http://djoscarg.net/">Oscar G's</a> and Ralph Falcon's birthday party. Murk boys in effect.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/jane-7808.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Hi Jane'" ></p>

<p>Both images, are obviously "club" images. One of my fortés happens to be nightlife photography, obviously, but as of late, I've been trying to expand my horizons and get away from the familiar pattern of colorfully-lit dancing girls, DJs, fog effects, and crowds. It's fun and I really enjoy it, but I have been trying to expand my repertoire a little bit, i.e. with my landscapes and scenic nighttime photography.</p>

<p>Which begs the question, can the creative process be forced? My two "score" images were generated off-the-cuff, with little technical thought to them. Lights are at <em>x</em>, so shutter speed at <em>y</em>, aperture at <em>z</em>, and ISO at <em>alpha</em>, and press the shutter button. The one of Jane actually had a little more thought to it since I saw the light on the wall and had to position her accordingly, but it wasn't a "planned" image in the sense that I spent time driving around and looking for it. Ms Jane wanted an image, and I gladly provided.</p>

<p>So maybe sometimes "don't think, just shoot" can lead to results as well. I'm definitely digging the end results. Even in the familiar territory of nightlife, I can still pull off a unique composition. And the process wasn't forced. I "had a vision and waited for the world to fall in line...". Maybe trying to force the world to fall in line doesn't work?</p>

<p>And of course having willing subjects helps enormously. Thanks to Jane, and Jordyn as well for participating in my lens antics this weekend.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving to my small and dedicated loyal readership. Keep it down out there, otherwise the guys above might have to move their cruisers off the grass and they usually don't like doing that...</p>

<p>And with that, the holiday season begins.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/bayfront-6921.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Challenger Monument'" ></p>

<p>The mad rush to the malls, 'Cyber Monday' as it were, and all the other associated commercial activity. Since I'll most likely be lazy and not blog about it on the day of, this weekend also features <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/11/21/3107988/small-business-saturday-the-anti.html">Small Business Saturday.</a></p>

<p>I can dig it. I like sorting out people I know. Plus, I'm all about the small and agile ethos. It's easier and more fun if you think about it.</p>

<p>And, in the spirt of Small Business Saturday and also the holidays, why not support a local small business (me), and purchase for yourself, or as a gift, one of my fine scenic pieces? I just recently put the above photo, 'Challenger Monument' up for sale. You can purchase a copy in any number of sizes, finishes, and mounting options (including canvas gallery wraps) by <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com">by clicking here</a>. I'll even knock 20 percent off the price. Just put the code 'ZESNLP' into the box at checkout, and the discount will be applied. Other prints available for purchase include popular images like...</p>

<p>This past weekend, The Martinez Brothers took to the decks at Space. They've got the youthful energy and enthusiasm in spades. Playing for well over ten hours, they kept the dancefloor moving until the afternoon...</p>

<p>I'm not ancient, by any measure, but by the time I left at 9, I was completely drained...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And the kids were still rocking it like they just woke up...</p>

<p>Objectively, I'm actually healthier than I've been in a long time. I try to eat right, and take care of myself. I still have a drink or five when I'm at the club (no one trusts you if you are without a drink in a nightclub...just nod and agree with me on this one) and I will be smart and pace myself. However, sometimes I'm just completely drained, even going into Monday. Is it all mental? Or has a decade and change in-scene finally started to catch up with me?</p>

<p>When I was The Brothers' age, I could do a 9-10 hour "shift" standing on my head, and still bounce back for whatever I had to do on Monday. I could even go out multiple nights a week till 5 AM. Now, I don't go to a club unless there's decent money involved. I'd rather relax with friends or just stay home and read/write/edit. Or go out and shoot scenics.</p>

<p>Maybe I am "getting old", who knows? I still enjoy the nightlife, but yeah, it does take a lot out of you, regardless of your health.</p>

<p>For my younger readers - this will happen to you. I can guarantee it. Trick is, pace yourself, but even then...</p>

<p>Maybe a vacation is in order.</p>

<p>One of my favorite DJ/Producers, <a href="http://www.djmarkknight.com/">Mark Knight</a>, stopped in at Space this past weekend for a little eight-hour set on the decks. He's got the idea of being a DJ down pat. He mixes in his own material and edits, with a good dose of anything that will make the crowd move. Throughout the night I heard everything from classic Underworld to even an INXS-inspired white label track. And he's always down for a wacky photo or two, like the one above. And, of course, I get asked 'how did I do that'?</p>

<p>In this case, it wasn't just a random happenstance of the lighting and the photo coming together...</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You have a vision and you wait for the world to fall in line and then you capture it...</p><footer><strong>Adriana D</strong> <cite>A Phone Conversation 12 October 2012</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Generally that is how I work. I wait for things to happen, as I've explained before, then I document it. However, in club life, an interesting 'counter' to my little tagline happens, in that the friendly local lighting techs will set up a specific cue, so I can capture the moment. So, I have to wonder, am I waiting for the world to fall in line if someone kind of knows what I would like to see?</p>

<p>I do appreciate the help, obviously, and it is actually not a hard feat for anyone to accomplish if they are out shooting nightlife. The trick here is, to get to know your light techs and the equipment they employ on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>When I first got started in this, I used to be a part-time light tech for my friend John's sound company. John and I, at the time, were both students over at UM, and to make ends meet, and also for the learning experience (his major was audio engineering), John ran a small sound and lighting company on the side. And I was his unofficial-official light tech, due to my experience with lighting in general, and also no one else in our crew knew the concepts. We didn't get paid much, but at the time, half the fun was just being able to get out there and do shows. We mostly did rock shows, but we also did a few dance-oriented events here and there. Nonetheless, I got to learn the basics of stage and nightclub lighting. As time went on, even after John moved back to Aspen to kick off his <a href="http://alchemyavcs.com/">massive production company</a>, I would stay current and always converse and on occasion, fill in as a tech for a lot of the local guys when they were sick, away or "otherwise indisposed". At this time (early to mid 2000s), lighting was moving from a "dedicated console" world, to a PC-driven sort of affair, especially in the nightclub industry. A $300 PC and $700 USB-DMX widget could take the place of a $20000 console in a nightclub setting. The most popular product was <a href="http://martinpro.com/product/product.asp?product=lightjockey">LightJockey</a> by Martin. In a nutshell, after you installed and connected all your fixtures, you used this piece of software and supplied USB-DMX widget, and could program and control your lightshow from any commodity PC. It is all very graphical.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/LJ.jpg" width="600" height="474" title="'Lightjockey 2.0'" ></p>

<p>There's several competing software packages out there nowadays, but Lightjockey is the most common one. The concepts are the same though.</p>

<p>And then, obviously, beyond the controller, is the entire world of the lighting fixtures themselves. Common manufacturers include <a href="http://martinpro.com/">Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.highend.com/">Highend</a>, <a href="http://www.elationlighting.com/">Elation</a>, <a href="http://claypaky.com/">Clay Paky</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>Entire blogs and sites are devoted to lighting. Obviously this one isn't. But, you don't have to be a light tech to speak the basics. The key, I've found, is to know what the fixtures are (spots, washes, scanners, strobes - all kind of self-explanatory), and the right terms for what the fixtures do (If you say 'CTO' you'll usually be taken a little bit more seriously) and what the colors and filters are, and also the basics of how a lighting scene is constructed. Also, if you don't know the tech, get to know him or her (yes, her - one of the best in the biz <a href="https://www.facebook.com/miss.allegra"> is a girl</a>.) and develop a rapport. If it's early in the night, the tech is usually just running through the motions, and will probably be up for a break in the routine. Use the opening DJ as a "practice target", and get some cues set up for yourself.</p>

<p>Now, this all kind of reeks of cheating. And, maybe it is. However, the way I can ethically justify it is now, in a lot of places, the tech will actually bring up "my" cues, without me even asking. At Space, I don't think I've asked Dennis or Gabriel for a specific cue in months. It just all falls into place. They know what will make for a great image, and more importantly, when to deploy those cues, for maximum effect on both the crowd and my image capture. We work together on it.</p>

<p>Plus, a good tech will know the flow and rhythm to the music and crowd, and having specific cues becomes less and less necessary, since the lighting will just happen. When a song peaks, you know there will be a sizable amount of strobing, for example. Or when there is a lull in the track, it could go dark, or a nice blue wash from the Platinum Beams will kick in.</p>

<p>Of course, the assumption being made here is that you are shooting in a venue that is equipped with a decent lighting rig, and, beyond that, a dedicated lighting technician. Some smaller venues still run their lighting systems on autopilot, or according to a preset schedule (Lightjockey allows for scheduled cues based on the time of day, even), depending on the needs of the venue. That being said, most places of that nature actually have a lot of practical lighting, or a good dose of ambient light. There's a lot of light out there if you know where to find it.</p>

<p>But, if the situation allows for it, definitely get to know and work with the light techs in a venue, the resultant images will be much more "meaningful" than your usual run-of-the-mill flash-and-dash captures.</p>
