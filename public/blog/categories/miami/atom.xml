<p>A lot of people ask me about my photos, "How did you do that?"</p>

<p>Well, truth be told, it isn't a huge secret on how I, or any other working photographer, pulls off their images...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I was having a discussion with <a href="http://ryanalynporter.com">Ryan</a> the other day, in response to my prior posting about <a href="http://www.dan-vidal.com/blog/2012/09/15/some-of-us-are-more-than-that-guy-with-the-camera/">being more than the guy with the camera.</a></p>

<p>Ryan bought forth the term <em>agalmics</em> during our discussion. In a nutshell, agalmics is:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The study and practice of the production and allocation of non-scarce goods.</p><footer><strong>Robert Levin</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.openverse.com/~dtinker/agalmics.html'>Agalmics - the Marginalization of Scarcity</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>And yes, that was an excuse to show off the shiny blockquote tag here in Octopress. Which actually ties into what I'm talking about here.</p>

<p>The internet has made knowledge of most subjects a non-scarce resource. From the implementation of the blockquote tag here on my blog, to just how the heck I composed that image of Roger that leads off the article, to the basic techniques Roger uses to mix music together in his DJ sets, the transfer of knowledge has definitely become a non-scarce resource. It's really not much of an exaggeration to say that the sum of human knowledge is online these days.</p>

<p>With a few exceptions, the directions on how to do just about anything have been documented online, and those directions are freely accessible. And if they are not freely accessible at first, some more searching will bring forth a free alternative on how to get something done. I mention that because some academic research is locked behind paywalls. However, similar research is often freely accessible, and the assiduous student can often come to the same conclusions the researchers hiding behind paywalls do.</p>

<p>But anyways, with regards to my photo work, I don't mind freely passing on the knowledge, even if I paid for it a long time ago. If I'm stingy with the knowledge, the person asking for it, if they are determined enough, will seek it out on their own, and undoubtedly discover it elsewhere. Ryan put it bluntly:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>An agalmic entrepreneur's currency is his reputation.</p><footer><strong>Ryan Porter</strong> <cite><a href='http://forum.talknightlife.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=20149&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a'>EDM Is the Wimpiest Youth Movement Ever? - TNL Thread</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>My reputation (other than being a scandal!) tends to lie in the direction that I am in possession of a lot of knowledge, and I have no qualms about giving it away. It's a currency that can be spent and earned just like money nowadays. And simply because people have faith that the knowledge will benefit them. Much like the US Dollar is only worth something because the world believes it is worth something. We've assigned value to it, and it is no longer based on the reserves of a scarce material, i.e. gold.</p>

<p>But unlike gold, knowledge and information are no longer scarce. It's all out there, free for the taking. Even if you do not own your own computer or have your own internet connection, you can avail yourself of free resources to get online, and access the same information a guy on his iPad next to his pool on Star Island can.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, I tend to not object if someone sincerely asks how I manage to pull something off in the photographic realm. I get something out of it, myself, personally. I tend to be a miserable rat bastard about some things, like the political system, the popularity of dubstep, ravers, fluorescent lighting, BlackBerries, and American Idol. So I guess, subconsciously, to balance out that deficit in the karma bank, I kind of get a visceral thrill when I can pass on what I've learned. That, and when it comes to photo work at least, I can only pass on the parameters of what I've done, it's up to the person I'm teaching to implement it at the right time. It's like your parents can tell you how to drive a car, but eventually you have to get behind the wheel and do it yourself. And once you are behind the wheel, it's a lot different than when Mom told you not to stomp on the accelerator.</p>

<p>And as far as someone using that knowledge against me? Well, I don't see it as being used against me, since I really don't play that game. If someone takes what I've showed them and apes my style, and gets more work than I do, that's fine. Even if they don't acknowledge where they learned it from. Recognition and attribution are nice and "proper internet etiquette", but I don't expect it these days. I figure it is something they have to live with. And I'm really not in the recognition game, either. If what I do helps a friend or a client do well, I usually get taken along for the ride. There's a lot of things at play out in the world that are way more powerful than myself, and I figure it's easier to just ride the wave and catch a ride, rather than try to take on those forces directly. Either way, I end up doing alright for myself.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I do plan on passing on little bits and pieces of what I know in this here blog, kind of as a way to balance out some of the more ornery aspects of it, and also just for the sake of composing my thoughts on "paper". Sometimes it'll be about photographic and video techniques I know, other times it'll be about coding this here site, and maybe on occasion some bits and pieces on the fine art of Mercedes maintenance as I learn more about that.</p>

<p>I'm on a bit of a roll right now, let me kick off the first one. In the next post. Let's keep this somewhat organized.</p>

<p>Like a lot of tourist areas, Miami has a high and low season. Typically, ours high season goes from late September until late April. Simply because of the weather.</p>

<p>Though in recent years there's been less of a difference, due to economic factors. The high season isn't as "high" as it used to be, and people will brave the torrid heat and humidity during the summer to save on hotel rates and flight costs.</p>

<p>But still, the fall season is almost here. Warm, but not torrid days, and cool breezy nights will be the norm. It's the time of the year which makes living in the Miami area worthwhile.</p>

<p>Already you can see the change. This past weekend saw temperatures in the mid-80s (upper 20s for you guys who use Celsius), with a noticeable decrease in humidity. The biggest indicator is I don't have to wait as long for the a/c unit in the 210 to bring things down to a reasonable level. I could crank it, sure, but oddly enough Mercedes says that "it really doesn't speed things up too much". And I'll side with the engineers on this one. The 210 is my baby of sorts.</p>

<p>And the excitement was definitely noticeable at Space over the weekend. Like I mentioned in my last post, the talented Roger Sanchez was on the decks. One of the few DJs on the scene not caught up with doing stage shows and 90-minute sets, Roger kept us going for over nine hours, from 3 AM - 12 noon. I broke my "Leave Space at 8:30" rule by a fair margin. It was worth it though. A lot of old friends showed up, and stayed late, so I figured I would as well. As a single guy, I kind of go where my friends are, ya know?</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/rs-6661.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'The S-Man himself!'" ></p>

<p>But Roger definitely delivered on the musical end. I'm not much of a trainspotter ("It's the song that goes mmmm-tsss right?") but he kept the crowd occupied with a great mix of diverse music, ranging from vocal-infused house to extended tribal percussive tracks. Which kept the people there socializing and dancing and drinking. A successful night for Space, by any metric. And a great photographic journey for me. I report what's there, and if what is there isn't interesting or compelling, it comes through in my work. And if it is interesting and compelling, it will definitely show. If you are of a mind, <a href="http://seenightlife.com/users/pod/albums/roger-sanchez-returns-to-space">click here</a> to see the end results. It's a bit of a large gallery due to the length of time I was present at Space, but there you have it.</p>

<p>The fall is here!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/pete-5469.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Jordyn on the box at Space'" ></p>

<p>Sometimes when I think about what to put here too much, I'm at a loss. I can't force myself to write. Usually, when I drop an article in here, it's in relation to something I've done, read, or saw. This blog is very reactive and not proactive right now, I guess. This post is definitely reactive.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago, I read a blog entry by local shooter <a href="http://helloimscott.com/">Scott Alexander</a> on how he's burnt out on his primary subject, erotica and fetish, but not for the reasons you would think.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In the <a href="http://helloimscott.com/2012/09/adapting-new-battle-strategies/">blog post</a>, he sums it up eloquently:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>But it’s more than just being burnt out from this business. It’s so many different things. I tire of people looking at me sideways or making assumptions about me and my life. I tire of the judgement. I tire, when meeting someone new, that because someone else has said something to them, they’ve already made up in their mind what I’m all about and don’t even TALK to me with any kind of respect. I tire of not being taken seriously.</p><footer><strong>Scott Alexander</strong> <cite><a href='http://helloimscott.com/2012/09/adapting-new-battle-strategies/'>Adapting New Battle Strategies</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>In a nutshell (correct me if I'm wrong Scott), it seems he is tired of being judged as a smut-peddler, when there's so much more to what he does.</p>

<p>Now, to a lesser extent, I encounter this on occasion when I talk to people about what I do, regardless of whether I meet them inside or outside of the club environment. Without sounding pretentious I like to think that I put my own spin on the images I capture. Since I have the luxury (haha) of running my own site, I have complete freedom to capture the images how I want them. Of course, I have to make some concessions with the client (that is why you will see photos that look like "typical" club shots), but I do have the flexibility to shoot what I want as well.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I can do that is the amount of time I've been rattling around Miami's club scene, which, by my watch, is around 15 years at this point. That's an eternity. I've been around longer than almost every venue in town, and most promoters and DJs. I got started in this when the post of 'club photographer' was a rare thing. And since it was rare, I was able to set the tone for myself, i.e. I wasn't under the gun to shoot 100000 images of drunk girls, and as time went on, even the people who wanted me to do so, ended up conceding, or moving on to someone who would shoot 10000 images of drunk girls.</p>

<p>In a nutshell that explains why I'm not rich off of photography and have to do web-related odd jobs to pay for things. Making money from producing just the photos (or any art for that matter) you want is extremely challenging.</p>

<p>In this modern era, I would probably not be able to score a single club-related photo gig if I was starting out. Simply because there's too many people/sites willing to shoot 10000 drunk-girl images for cheap, and almost zero demand for any sort of artistry in the photos captured. Nightclubs just want photos for social network promotion. And hey, they're running a business, and it costs an obscene amount of money to run it. FYI, a large nightclub costs around $30,000 a night sans DJ fees just to operate! So yeah, they kind of need people to show up.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I've got work via my veteran status and longtime connects, but if I had to do it all over again today (with the same eye/mindset), I probably wouldn't do it at all.</p>

<p>However, many would and are doing it. They will shoot 10000 photos a night of drunk girls with their cameras on "P" or green mode. Fire away, give 'em the little card, and move on to the next target. And annoy the DJ while they are at it.</p>

<p>And unfortunately, since this type of photographer is ubiquitous to the club scene, I'm sometimes lumped into the same mold as they are. Much as Scott is probably lumped into the same mold as whomever does the shooting for Bangbus, even though their material is worlds apart.</p>

<p>I see it sometimes, when people ask me what I shoot, and I try my best to sugarcoat it. "Yes, I shoot special events, concerts, and nightlife...". Which basically means I spend time taking photos in loud, hot, smoky rooms filled to the gills with drunk people.</p>

<p>However, even in those loud, smoky, drunk rooms, there's ample opportunity to compose and capture aesthetically pleasing images. The image up top is one example.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ldw-4558.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Jordyn again - yes, I shoot her a lot'" ></p>

<p>This would be another. In my humble opinion, this isn't a side of nightlife that people normally notice. And I like to capture that, to show those rare moments when something visually amazing happens for a split second, in a place most people consider just a loud, hot, smoky, drunk room.</p>

<p>It's why I carry sample images on my iPhone of what I'm able to do. If I can hold someone's attention for five seconds before they run away, since they judge me as being "That guy with the camera in the club...", I usually show them just what I mean. Then their opinions change.</p>

<p>However, on occasion the whole issue does get tiring. Which is why I've branched out into shooting scenics recently. Now, it's not to force myself to shoot something I don't like. I really do like scenics. On occasion in the past I've shot some rather stunning ones. But nowadays, I've actually begun to market myself as being able to do that as well. The nice thing is, I'm able to spring that as a surprise on the unsuspecting critic.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/bridge-4199_blog.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Islamorada Crossing'" ></p>

<p>Plus it's pretty relaxing. I actually took this photo and then just sat down under the bridge for an hour afterwards.</p>

<p>This last piece has actually sold a few copies over on my <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com">FAA page</a>. And when I show it to a critic who lumps me in with the likes of the unscrupulous run-and-gun shooters, they usually get quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>However, even if they do walk away, I don't mind. I still find enjoyment in shooting nightlife and events. The varied situations, the challenge of shooting in dark rooms, the dynamics, and getting to see some friends of mine all contribute to that, even after fifteen years. The burnout feeling comes and goes, but for the most part, it goes. Sometimes when I want to just stop, I'll find some glimmer (no kids, 'glimmer' is not the name of a new drug!) that keeps me going. Aside from the fact that I can't argue with the money, of course.</p>

<p>I'll be at Space tonight/tomorrow morning around 3 AM for one of the few good DJs left in the scene, Roger Sanchez. If anyone from here reads this and is there, come and say hello. I'll explain more in detail time permitting.</p>

<p>Scott, if you're reading, don't take any guff from those swine. You've got a great body of work, and it speaks for itself. If anything drop on them your collection from driving across the country and back on a scooter. That was amazing.</p>

<p>Sidebar: I drove across the country once. It was in a moving van equipped with an first-gen iPad 3G, 3 diverse smartphones, a cooler full of rations, and spares for everything. Halfway through I wanted to blow up the moving van and take my camera backpack, iPad, and some clothes and go buy a cheap scooter and finish the ride that way by going the scenic route. I'm gonna figure out how to make these sidebars on the side, soon.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/15/you-need-to-think-fourth-dimensionally-marty</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/49508063" width="960" height="540" frameborder="1" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/49508063">• Season 8 Finals - Jive With The Band •</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/dvdigital">Dan V</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.</p></p>

<p>I'm relearning the fine art of video editing. I learned on an analog system (real film!) though the concepts carry over. It's all about the story.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>My current weapon of choice for editing is Final Cut Pro X. While the dyed-in-the-wool digital video types give it hell for being too much like iMovie and not a "real" pro product like it was, I find FCP-X suits my fancy for the basic video projects I'm doing myself at the moment. Like I've mentioned in the past, I usually just shoot, and pass my results off to someone with more editing and VFX skills like <a href="http://deepsleepstudio.com/">Alex and his team over at Deepsleep</a>. However, even they use Final Cut Pro X for their final editing workflow.</p>

<p>In the end, an edit is an edit. You're trying to tell a story, and all the VFX goodies and title transitions in the world won't help if your timing and sequencing is off. That's actually something that takes years to master. I know in my head where I want to go with the story, I'm still just learning the modern tools of the trade. So yes, sometimes my edits are "off". It's a work in progress.</p>

<p>You have to think fourth-dimensionally. When shooting and when editing. You have to have an idea of what you want to shoot, and during the edit, what you have in your "bin". In an event like Jive, the regular repeat singers often perform twice throughout the night, once in the beginning, and once near the end to really knock the crowd out. I have to remember that sometimes I'll have "better" footage of say, Sir Diego, from later on in the night, even if his first performance knocked it out of the park. Sometimes it's the reverse actually. Either way, I have to keep in mind I have multiple takes. Keeping the bin coherent is key.</p>

<p>And this is just on the video side. The audio side is a whole other ball of wax. I record with a basic Sennheiser stereo mic, though I do want to progress to one of their wireless kits where I take a feed straight from the FOH mixer at the bar. That is a $600 investment though, and I'm currently not shooting enough live music events to justify the outlay. It's an amazing widget regardless, though.</p>

<p>Regardless, if you are a photographer getting into video, just remember to think fourth-dimensionally. You are composing a project that exists not only in space, but in time.</p>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/12/when-did-the-dj-become-more-important-than-the-crowd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/pete-5312.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Thanks!'" ></p>

<p>A random blog post over at <a href="http://www.faithfanzine.com/?p=1590">Faith Fanzine</a> caught my eye today. One quote from the article summed it up:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>When did we start watching a DJ instead of dancing with our mates , why do we put up with idiotic people taking up the floor who are filming the DJ ,why is the best dance floors now being cut to ribbons to provide extra table space for naff VIP’s ( Pacha in Ibiza hang your head in shame ) ,people with more money than taste and who in some extreme situations in the US have had DJs thrown off the decks because they did not like the music .</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Yes, when did we stop dancing?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>I can't dance, that's a given. I pop around and do monkey moves, get embarrassed, and then I shuffle off to the side. But in the end, I'm still interacting with the crowd and my friends, and squeezing in a few photo ops as I mix and mingle. I take a few (OK a lot in some cases!) photos of the DJ, but I'm not in the middle of the dancefloor gawking at the booth the entire night.</p>

<p>It's actually part of the reason I prefer clubs to the current form of dance music experience, the festival/concert setup.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://seenightlife.com/photos/5595/original_MIA-6086.jpg" width="427" height="640"></p>

<p>In those setups, there is a stage, and a general admission "pit", much like a rock concert. The setup works well for rock concerts, since the whole point of a live musical act performing on stage is so you can see them work their instruments and sing. The act of a DJ mixing, no matter what tools they use, is generally a very passive act, and doesn't lend itself much to a rock-performance aesthetic, no matter how much jumping around and handwaving the DJ is doing. Anything more than that (I'm looking at you, Aoki), smacks of being too contrived and "trying too hard". Essentially the guy playing other people's music in the club has been placed in the center of a stage usually reserved for rockstars. And no matter how many pretty LED screens and image-mapped 3D renderings one throws up there, it comes down to that he's still up there playing back prerecorded sounds in a predetermined sequence. And a lot of DJs in concert situations don't even alter their playlists much from date to date. Zero musical flexibility. Might as well put an iPhone up there and play a prerecorded mix.</p>

<p>Plus, the shows are often at capacity, so there is actually zero room for dancing, and certainly no room for social interaction, since everyone is either focused on the guy pressing play on their laptop, or has their head buried in their phone, stroking their ego on Facebook.</p>

<p>I'm generally regarded as a borderline sociopathic personality. However, I do value social interaction when I'm out for a night of entertainment. It's why I value the few clubs left that actually encourage social discourse and interaction. Venues in town like Space, the Vagabond, and so forth, while they book DJ talent, don't rely on the DJ exclusively to drive their business. Some of my best nights out have been with the local guys on the decks, and I'm just there with my friends, having a good time. Some DJs still get it. <a href="http://seenightlife.com/users/pod/albums/pete-tong-at-space">Pete Tong</a> is a great example. This past weekend, he took to the decks at Space. No grandstanding, no tricks, he just played a great soundtrack to a night/morning out, and the crowd responded in kind. People were dancing, socializing, and having a good time, but not buried in their phones or gawking at the booth for hours on end. So there's hope...</p>

<p>Let's save the rockstar setup for the rockstars.</p>
