<p>It was one of those random "on and off" weekends.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Much like any other mental factor, creativity seems to have a finite supply of sorts, and can be slow to replenish. Thursday, I shot a scenic I'm really proud of, the aptly-titled (yes, I'm totally being narcissistic here) "Where The Buses Don't Run".</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/outwhere_rev-8882.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'US 27 Northbound Broward County'" ></p>

<p>I did this on a Thursday night/Friday morning, and I did the editing and "mastering" work on Friday. When I intend to sell a print, I tend to nitpick. I'll obsess over minute color corrections, lens flares, and wish for things like my print provider accepting TIFF uploads on the off chance there's some minor compression artifacts which could be visible at a large enough print size.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, "Out Where The Buses Don't Run" is for sale on my <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">Fine Art America</a> site, along with eight other pieces I consider potential sellers. I'm getting more and more into shooting nighttime scenics. Though I could do without the bugs in the Everglades. There was a mosquito in the 210 on my way home that night. The hardest part was concentrating on keeping steady at 130 km/h while hoping the little bastard would just go away. I did the "open all windows and go even faster" trick and that seemed to help.</p>

<p>That being said, I was fully intent on going back out to shoot more scenics on Friday, but that actually never panned out. I couldn't think of a location to scope out. I might try west this week, now that I think about it.</p>

<p>Saturday was my usual club night over at <a href="http://clubspace.com/">Space</a>. Two of my favorites, Chus + Ceballos, were on hand to provide an extended musical soundtrack to the evening. These guys "get it", they know they are there to keep the crowd moving, and they provide an excellent musical selection over the course of ten or more hours on the decks. Great guys in person, too. They're always game for the photo op, and they actually love to meet their fans. They <a href="http://www.dan-vidal.com/blog/2012/09/06/the-musical-ecosystem/">know their place in the musical ecosystem</a>.</p>

<p>I still have to figure out how to derive that media_id without having to manually kick the Instagram API. If anyone knows how, let me know.</p>

<p>That being said, I definitely had "more creative energy" by that Saturday night. Some plans for early hours didn't materialize. I was supposed to attend a bachelor/bachelorette party at Scarlett's up in Hollywood, but the "confirmation" message never arrived that the people were actually gonna go. By then, it was 1:30 in the morning and I was already framing my mind from staring at desperate girls on the pole to actually doing something productive. So, I kind of said "the hell with it", jumped into a <a href="http://miami.car2go.com/">Car 2 Go</a>, and drove on over to Space.</p>

<p>Car 2 Go is saving me so much money in cab fare. It's amazing. Plus, they never thought of my use case until I told them. They posted on Facebook about using their service to get to the Brickell Oktoberfest party, and taking the safe way (a cab) home. Agalmic cowboy diplomacy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lostios2012-9217.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Hi Jordyn'" ></p>

<p>Anyways, Space was the usual 'rock' of Miami nightlife this past weekend. Great atmosphere, an interesting crowd, and great music. It's not a trendy VIP club, and it doesn't aspire to be. In my mind it's the heart of Miami nightlife. It is one venue you can go to without even bothering to check their website to see who is playing. A friend of mine suggested that their marketing campaign should be "Space: We're fucking open."</p>

<p>I did my usual rounds at the venue, including switching out to the 50 1.2 L as the morning rolled on. It's a learning curve, but one I'm glad to participate in. It's a great lens and you can do amazing things with it wide open. Every Canon user should have it in their arsenal.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lostios2012-9335.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Lucy I'm Home'" ></p>

<p>At 1.2, you will have throwaway images. Nature of the beast in a nightclub. Just keep shooting, but don't turn it into a Golden BB spray-and-pray affair. If the shot doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.</p>

<p>I left a little after 9 AM Sunday morning. I woke up Sunday afternoon, since I had a Keys trip planned, but the weather totally did not cooperate. I ended up turning around on the Turnpike Extension after a huge downpour kicked in, with more forecast for Monday. Though Monday turned out to be a rather nice day. Such is luck I guess.</p>

<p>I'll try to make it down again in the next few weeks. Maybe after Halloween Weekend.</p>

<p>Totally random weekend.</p>

<p>If you really want to get out into where it gets dark, you should probably head north and west along US 27 if you live or are shooting in the metropolitan Miami area...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It's definitely out where the buses don't run.</p>

<p><iframe width="" height="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hIv-YaVBtA8 " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<p>I miss Miami Vice.</p>

<p>You'll see a bit of the old South Florida when you get out that way. Before the sprawl and the overdevelopment.</p>

<p>This image was done with my 50 1.2 L. So far, so good. I'm definitely happy with the purchase. Prime lenses give you that extra five percent in overall image quality, and the 50 doesn't disappoint in this regard.</p>

<p>This is a 30 second exposure from the side of US 27 heading northbound just over the county line into Broward. There was a small amount of moonlight partially obscured by clouds. The rest is all ambient light, including airglow, the distant Miami city lights, and the lights of passing vehicles.</p>

<p>I'm sure the truckers were wondering what I was doing at 1:30 in the morning on the side of the road. Protip, bring a flashlight, and just point it at the ground when vehicles are coming close.</p>

<p>I'll be putting this one up for sale soon at my <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">FAA</a> site.</p>

<p>Even though I think social networking is mainly a lot of hype, snake oil, and the dumbing down of the narcissistic masses even further, I'll gladly admit my addiction to Instagram. At least to do something meaningful with it, you have to overcome the limitations of your iPhone camera, and go for what's there. It's part of the challenge, to me. Plus, I like the UI and the way it sends your photo while you think of some pithy caption, so it almost appears to upload at warp speed.</p>

<p>There's a trend on Instagram, called "Throwback Thursday". Well, it's Thursday right now. So I like to do throwbacks when I can.</p>

<p>I first saw this when I jumped on Instagram a few months ago. People would post photos from their past, and call them "throwbacks". Now, of course, the limit of the throwback is tied to the age of the image that is being posted. And, most images being posted are straight from a digital source. And unless you were in the photo biz, you had no easy way to digitize your old film shots.</p>

<p>When I shot film, I had a film scanner. Not a flatbed to scan prints, which was essentially making second-generation copies, but a full-on "digital enlarger", which actually had 1/3 the resolution of my current digital SLR, oddly enough. It was a Minolta unit, which actually was old when I bought it, and required me to get an equally-old <em>SCSI</em> (remember SCSI?) adapter card for my homebuilt PC to make it work. It was painfully slow. An average photo session from a club took about 3 hours to scan in if I wanted the proper results.</p>

<p>As time went on, I obviously upgraded to digital (in mid-2003 no less!) with a Canon 10D DSLR. I stowed my Minolta scanner, and actually never touched it again. By the time it occurred to me that maybe I'd want a film scanner to bring back some of those old archived images, it was well past the time when I even had a desktop PC with which it could be used. I had migrated to Apple, and obviously my Macbook had only USB and Firewire ports. Yes, I know Nikon, Imacon, and others make USB and Firewire film scanners, but, economies of scale did not touch them, and they were still as expensive and as rare as the days they were a common item in professional photo labs around the world. There were some cheap brand-X scanners on eBay, but the results were disappointing. And I wasn't about to ship my negatives and chromes to New York, just to have them scanned in. No one is asking for the old stuff for any commercial reasons, anyways, i.e. I couldn't warrant a film scanner purchase just for social media use.</p>

<p>Now, I know what is being asked, "Hey, Pod, didn't you save the files you made from the scans?"</p>

<p>Well, actually I only saved the final JPEG files, which in those days I only saved them at 320 px across in the long dimension to fit the specs for CJ. It wasn't worth saving the TIFF files since if I was printing, I would just do it at the pro lab I worked at at the time on their Frontier system or traditional darkroom. And the only reason to go to TIFF was for archival reasons, and if you had the negs and chromes (which I do), you already had an archive. However, that archive might as well be on the moon as far as quickly accessing it is concerned.</p>

<p>That being said, I did a fun trick for the Tiësto image at the start of this article. That one is from 2002. Nick sent me out to this Nettwerk America record label event at the Aqua Hotel on Collins Avenue, to take photos of "this Tiësto guy", while a writer he drafted interviewed him. Hah, the days of real interviews.</p>

<p>Anyways...what I did to get this "digital" was that I made a pure white block on my Macbook Air's monitor, and laid the chrome of Tijs over it. The white light shines through the chrome, making it visible. Then I used my iPhone camera to take a photo of the chrome laid over the white block. Insta-lightbox-low-res-social-media-scanner. And if you want to do a "scan" of a negative, you just do the same thing, export to Photoshop, invert the colors, do some balancing, and you've got yourself a quick and dirty capture of an old analog image. It's not Imacon quality (but then again, what else is?), but to impress all your friends and mindless followers on Instagram, it's definitely sufficient. A step up would be to rig up your DSLR and do it at a higher resolution. However, then you are picking up the individual elements of the screen unless you have a Retina display. At that point you should probably just secure a lightbox from eBay. Hmm, wait...</p>

<p>Since this blog is partially educational, I'm putting this idea out to the community free of charge. All I ask is if you use this technique, just tag your Instagrams with #podscan and @pod_gram. Attribution is always welcome, and it's what people used to do. Your image and caption can be a throwback!</p>

<p>Happy Throwback Thursday.</p>

Sasha and Michelle mix up some nu-disco and more for your listening enjoyment. Press play, the audio player works! And yes, all things considered, if I was a DJ, I'd play nu-disco.

<p>Well, today was a bit contentious. But in a good way. My prior commentary on the <a href="http://edmsnob.com/">EDM Snob</a> revealing himself generated a fair amount of buzz, and also some direct emails to me. Some agreed with me, some didn't, but the magic was that they went through the trouble to email me and their replies were well-prepared and thought out. Even if you think I'm wrong, I always appreciate a well-crafted message. To quote my friend <a href="http://pingup.com/">Dade</a>, "It's the nuances I appreciate..."</p>

<p>That being said, I'm sure my benign lens review will generate far less controversy and commentary. I spew forth about the de-anonymizing of some guy in the dance music scene and it's game on. I post an educational piece and I get one reply.</p>

<p>Anyways, let's be an agalmic cowboy and balance out the karma bank a bit.</p>

<p>I recently decided to live a little and invest in a 50 1.2 L prime lens from Canon. This is currently the fastest lens that Canon currently produces. With a maximum aperture of 1.2, this lens can practically "see in the dark".</p>

<p>I'm not going to bore you guys with MTF charts and line pairs per mm comparisons. It's been done. This lens has been around for about a decade now, and the scientific reviews have been done and done again. Instead, I'm going to speak about my personal experience with this lens thus far.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lpm-7530.jpg" width="640" height="960" title="'Jordyn 50 1.2 L'" ></p>

<p>I picked it up used from <a href="http://adorama.com/">Adorama</a> for a shade over $1200 US total. Adorama rated the condition as "E+" which basically means it was probably a floor demo or something to that effect. The date code has the construction of this specific copy of the lens of sometime in 2008. Now, according to most photo bloggers, the date code matters little, since typically high-priced pieces of glass sometimes can sit for years before they ship out to retailers, or in fact sit on the shelves of the retailers themselves for awhile. So, even though this copy is almost 5 years old, it arrived looking as fresh as the day Canon made it. Adorama of course inspected it and cleaned it, but you can still tell when a lens has been taken care of. Included was a front and rear cap, and even the lens hood, which is normally a separate item.</p>

<p>The build quality is consistent with the other L-series lenses by Canon. Metal housing and mount, and a great deal of weight. This isn't a light lens by any stretch. The main reason I bought this, other than the fast 1.2 maximum aperture, was the build. Shooting clubs and events can beat up your gear, so I don't like to take chances.</p>

<p>Case in point, a few years ago, I owned the Canon EF-S 17-55 2.8 IS lens. A wonderful piece of glass in it's own right, this was the "L" lens of the EF-S (crop body mount) lenses. However, it didn't have the build quality of a true L lens, and after about a year, the IS mechanism failed on it. Rather than repair it, I sold it to <a href="http://keh.com">KEH</a> and got a credit towards my current ultrawide angle champ, the 16-35 2.8 L, which has served me faithfully for over six years now.</p>

<p>If you shoot in any sort of environment that could be considered "rough", buy your glass accordingly. It might seem strange to pay $1200 for a fixed focal length lens, but the build quality will save you money in the long run.</p>

<p>However, all the build quality in the world matters not, if the lens itself does not perform.</p>

<p>And perform it does.</p>

<p>The color rendition is amazing. Vivid, though accurate, with very little chromatic aberration, which can be fixed in post if it bothers you that much. The sharpness is unrivaled by any other 50mm prime I've tried, whether it be the Canon 50mm 1.4, or any number of third-party primes in that class. L glass is simply in a class of it's own. At it's max aperture of 1.2 your subject is decently sharp. The sweet spot for this piece of glass is from around 2.8 and up to f8 in my experience. This is simply a superb piece of prime glass.</p>

<p>However, shooting with it can be a personal challenge. Unlike it's bulkier, more expensive cousin, the 85mm 1.2 L, the 50 1.2 L has a decent autofocus mechanism. Your AF will land all the time, every time, where you want it. This is dependent on your body though. The 5D MK II I use isn't known for having the best autofocus, but I have my ST-E2 with it's assist beam to help things along. I landed my AF almost every time. Now, with that being said, I was experimenting with shooting at the max aperture of 1.2 a lot of the time.</p>

<p>Even at lesser ISOs than 6400, at 1.2 you are letting in a lot of light. Of course the tradeoff is that your depth of field is insanely shallow. Using a handy <a href="http://www.dofmaster.com/dofjs.html">depth-of-field</a> calculator, you can see that it is around <em>.07 feet</em> at the distance I took the above photo of Roland at. So, not much to work with. Some not used to this shallow DOF blame the lens. It's not the lens, it's you. It's just real challenging to shoot at that shallow depth of field and land your shot properly. You will need to take multiple images and also, if possible, advise your subject to stay as still as possible. If they move, your composition can be thrown off as your specific focus point can move out of the acceptable area of focus.</p>

<p>Though it is the challenge that makes it fun. While you might have a lot of throwaways at first, after time you will get used to the unique qualities of this amazing lens. I haven't used it consistently enough yet, but now that I own a copy, I know I will get better with it over time. I've already landed quite a few unique images because of this, and I know I will do more as I get acquainted with the properties of this lens. Having the capability to go that shallow with your depth of field can yield some amazing results, whether you are in a nightclub environment, or a controlled daytime situation.</p>

<p>Even with the challenges of shooting with it, I can definitely recommend this lens. You can save a lot of money by buying it's cheaper cousin, the 50 1.4, however, the faster aperture and superb build quality of the 50 1.2 L will make up for the savings over the course of time. L glass is for a lifetime, and investing in it is definitely worth the effort.</p>

I will definitely be posting more examples of what this lens can do as time goes on, including on how this is ideal for video.</p>
