<p>iOS 6 allows iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 users to take panoramas using the native Camera App. It's kinda cool.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>I'm actually very impressed with the results, considering it's generated with the camera inside of a phone. There's noise and so forth, but as a quick "live" panoramic tool, it is great.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm aware apps exist that do this anyways on both iOS and Android, but this functionality baked in, as it were, is pretty nifty. It also allows for smoother integration in terms of sending out via email or social media.</p>

<p>Now, even more so, the death of the pocket camera is imminent. An iPhone can take awesome images, as well as being a general-purpose pocket computer/communicator. The market in cameras will define itself by three tiers:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>DSLRs</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Pretty much what you see today. Digital still/video cameras with their roots in film SLRs, with the same accessories and lens systems.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Compact "rangefinder" style cameras.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Small bodies with or without interchangeable lenses with a large sensor. Think of the Sony NEX line or Canon's EOS-M. You'll see pros pick these up as a secondary or a "stealth" camera. And well-heeled hobbyists who want a nice system but without the bulk of a DSLR.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Cameras built into smartphones and tablets.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The iPhone 4s and the forthcoming iPhone 5 cameras are superb. Except for the flash function, it still sucks. But if you know what you are doing, who needs flash? There's apps that allow full manual control of the cameras, too. So there's your pocket camera solution.</p>

    <link href="http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/08/wynwood-artwalk-too-hot-to-handle/"/>

    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/08/wynwood-artwalk-too-hot-to-handle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/artwalk.jpg" width="960" height="960" title="'Artwalk Wynwood Artwalk Miami'" ></p>

<p>Though I guess I could be considered part of the Miami art community, I almost never go to Artwalk in Wynwood. I'm usually busy Saturday nights, or I consider my rare downtime more valuable than bouncing from gallery to gallery, most of which probably wouldn't exhibit anything I do. Photography is sort of underrepresented at Artwalk, but that's for another rant.</p>

<p>So anyways, the rare times I go to it are last-minute call-ups like I did earlier tonight.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I got a text from my good friend <strong>Emi Guerra</strong>, he wanted to go out and cruise Artwalk and meet some of the Miami art community to tell them about his forthcoming <strong>UR1 Festival</strong>, the big music and art festival taking place on December 8th and 9th during Art Basel. The big announcement of the lineup is Monday, even though it has been leaked. So I won't post it here since you can find it <a href="http://forum.talknightlife.com/">elsewhere.</a>.</p>

<p>But anyways, he wanted to go out and see the artists and art people. Makes sense if you are throwing an art-oriented festival. And, since I'm kinda in touch with these people (am I?) he invited me along.</p>

<p>So, I jumped into the 210 and zipped on down Biscayne to Wynwood.</p>

<p>Once I got to the area, what a bloody mission. Traffic was at a gridlocked standstill, and there were throngs of people out and about, to the point where Northwest 2nd Avenue was a pedestrian thoroughfare. I was supposed to meet Emi and his UR1 team at Wynwood Walls, and I ended up having to park about seven blocks away. I'm a healthy boy now so it's no big deal, but it's the principle. And I will not valet. The 210 isn't an SLS or an E 63, but it's my baby and no one except me and the crew at <a href="http://masterclassauto.com/">Masterclass Auto</a> touches the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Some have called for the major streets of Wynwood to be closed off to automotive traffic during Artwalk. 100 percent, yes. Please. Do this. Commissioner Sarnoff, it's your district (for now), make it happen. The cops have their hands full pushing vehicular and pedestrian traffic around, and it's a complete cluster down there, and it actually hampers the enjoyment of Artwalk.</p>

<p>So yes, Artwalk has truly exploded into a Miami social phenomenon. We officially have an art scene here as far as I'm concerned. Go us.</p>

<p>However, I finally did get situated, and met Emi, along with UR1's Jackie Richie, Emi's assistant Andrea, Alex Martinez of <a href="http://deepsleepstudio.com">Deepsleep</a>, and a few other scene people I know at Wynwood Walls, which was "at capacty" and had this weird dining area with a velvet rope and such set up.</p>

<p>They gotta update the artwork there. It's been the same since I last went to Artwalk (oddly enough with Emi's brother, Eddy) over two years ago. I'll paint a wall. It won't be anything "arty", but it will be something from my mind. I'll mention it here even.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, everyone was out in force. Now, was everyone into the art? Hardly. Most people "Artwalking" couldn't tell you if that was a piece by Nagelbett or Britto. They are out for the social experience. Emi phrased it best when he said, "They are out for something to do, and it's cheap to go to Artwalk. Shit is expensive these days..."</p>

<p>He hit the nail on the head. Shit is expensive these days. Dinner for two will run you $100 or more. A night out at a club, even Space, will run you $100 per person (drinks, cover, and so on) or more if you VIP it. Having fun costs money!</p>

<p>But not at Artwalk. The galleries often have cash bars and/or free (albeit low-quality) booze on hand. They usually arrange a sponsorship or something. And the food trucks are out in force, and the food is cheap, though I wouldn't necessarily trust it. Yeah, the modern food trucks have all the amenities, but it's still a food truck, ya know? We called 'em the "roach coaches" back in Jersey. Note to food truck owners, I'm not saying that your food truck has roaches. If you're that concerned about what I said, you probably have something to hide. Be confident in your product and people talking shit, like me, won't affect your business. Let freedom ring.</p>

<p>But yes, anyways, people are out for Artwalk because it's cheap, interesting, and there's a good social dynamic. And the galleries and artists put up with it since it will get their works exposed to the five percent of the people who actually know their art and are in a position to do something about it.</p>

<p>And yes, please block off the streets. Artwalk is now truly a "phenomenon" and it needs to be handled properly. Our art scene is finally getting some worldwide respect, and it'd be a shame if logistical squabbles killed off a major component of it.</p>

<p>Maybe I should run for the City Commission and make Artwalk one of my campaign platforms...</p>

<p>Sidebar: Yes, I'm aware the issues mentioned here are old. But these first few articles on my blog are kind of for SEO purposes, as well as stuff that is on my mind, regardless of when it happened. It's my blog, after all.</p>

<p>Sidebar 2: Yes, this devolved into a rant. In a nutshell, I did have fun at Artwalk. The food truck area is a great concept. Get 'em all in one place. Also, good seeing the <a href="http://car2go.com/">Miami Car2Go</a> people out...thanks for the T-shirt guys.</p>

    <link href="http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/on-the-premise-of-exclusivity/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-06T19:12:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/on-the-premise-of-exclusivity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ex.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'MK II overlooking Space'" ></p>

<p>Over the years, a lot of people have been under the mistaken assumption that I've been the "exclusive" photographer for venues and events I've worked with.</p>

<p>I don't enforce or expect exclusivity, and here's why...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At the root of it all, I'm only one person. I can only be in so many places within a venue at once, especially if it's a large scale venue such as Space. I'll be upstairs on the Terrace, but the Loft might be uncovered, or the Ballroom. There isn't money in the budget to clone me.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that photographers prior to me didn't enforce exclusivity with their venue clients was an enormous boost to me being able to do what I do today. If they hadn't left that door open, I might not have been as far along as I am today. However, back when I got started, the position/gig of "club photographer" was a rare one indeed. More on that in a minute.</p>

<p>And, if I were a large-scale venue manager/owner, and I had it in the budget, I would definitely want multiple photographic perspectives on what was going on that evening. Each and every person who picks up a camera has their own thoughts and ideas on how an image should come out, and it is a definite advertising boon to have those multiple perspectives represented. And in the case of email-harvesting sites posing as photo sites, the venue gets multiple sources of data. I don't necessarily approve of the tactic, but it is what it is, and if I were a venue owner or manager, I would avail myself of a few of those sites.</p>

<p>Finally, to be honest, enforcing exclusivity and being "the guy" is a real <em>pain</em>. You're expected to be everywhere at once, cover the event exactly in the style the client wants, which may not be your style, and the task of club photographer rapidly turns from a fun profession to a "job", i.e. something you have to do to make money. And, frankly, I can think of many healthier activities that aren't fun to do at all, that would earn me the same money or more that I do documenting the nightclub scene. I do it primarily because I love to do it, and the financial benefits are just the icing on the cake. You don't see people clamoring to spend thousands of dollars on camera equipment just to take it into a smoke-filled room with loud music and sloppy drunk people because it's a job.</p>

<p>However, the situation today could be regarded as a little different. Since I got started, the position of club photographer has gone from a rare job description, to one of almost ubiquity. Often, the last thing a party would consider is booking a photographer to document an event. It was usually a "6 PM on the night of the event" request, if they thought about it at all. Of course the internet changed that.</p>

<p>Now, if you throw a party at a club, it's expected that you will have at least one or two guys on hand to document the event. However, some venues tend to go a little overboard, thinking any exposure is good, and let any guy with an SLR and an excuse into the venue. With the modern set of circumstances in mind, I'd at least require that the shooter have a full-fledged website (and not just a Facebook page or Flickr gallery) with which their images were to be posted. And, I'd probably cap the amount of shooters within a venue to a certain amount to avoid "shooting gallery" syndrome where there is, in fact, ten or more shooters in a venue. So, exclusivity on one person, not so much, but not overkill like some places are now. Especially if you add in everyone with their iPhones blazing away. But that's for another rant.</p>

<p>If you're in the club shooting world, keep shooting. Don't expect or enforce exclusivity though, it's not practical and definitely not in the spirit of things. There's enough subject matter for all (well, most) of us.</p>

    <updated>2012-09-06T02:24:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/the-musical-ecosystem</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/jive-4963.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Guy yelling at Adam'" ></p>

<p>I like shooting live concerts. There's more than one guy or girl on stage, and there's a lot of activity to document, from the vocalist to the instrumentalists, there's always someone moving about and in action. Plus, the lighting can't be argued with since the whole point of them being lit is to be seen. I actually like that almost every Tuesday I get to shoot Jive at Blue Martini Brickell.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It's a singing contest of sorts, but it brings out some real talent. Whether they are there for fun or hoping for a big break, I don't know, but it's a fun event to shoot. The band, Higher Ground, is on point with their covers, so it gives the contestants a real thrill to have a genuine live band behind them. And the dynamics of shooting it are a welcome change from my usual club shooting.</p>

<p>Not that I mind the DJ-oriented shooting. It's interesting, still after all these years, even with the proliferation of the DJ-as-rockstar during this current dance music bubble. Though some of these guys, it's gone to their heads.</p>

<p>When I first started this, over a decade ago, DJs kind of knew where they fit in within the musical ecosystem. They were curators and purveyors of music. Even if they produced their own tracks, they were still sought after and regarded first and foremost, as musical librarians of a sort. You went to a specific DJ's club night to hear new music since you trusted their musical taste was in line with yours. The end result was that you hopefully would go out to the record store the next day and purchase the tracks you heard. Even when the internet flipped the record store idea on it's face, the hope was you'd go to your online record shop and do the same.</p>

<p>Then came the rockstar phenomenon. DJs demanded more and more salaries, for correspondingly less work. Even disregarding automation, most DJs are content to go from A to B and back again and ask for a $50,000 paycheck. I can remember when DJs would get paid a tenth of that, and do far more work behind the decks, even when the change from vinyl to CDs happened. And most of all, DJs knew where they fit in the scheme of things. They knew their job was to provide the soundtrack for a night out, not be the sole focus of a night out. They helped maintain the dynamic of providing great music to a party. Now, unfortunately, we're in a sort of twilight zone where DJs get stage setups that rival those of genuine musicians, all to frame them pressing some keys on a Macbook. Now, some of the kids might argue that they're "really doing something" up there, but the sad fact is, it's all just sequencing and basic mixing. Very few DJs are actually doing anything innovative with the tools at hand. Though, those that are, ironically enough, are working the club scene and not about being the glory hogs of the world. You have veterans like Carl Cox who still throw down ten hour sets, working three or four inputs at once, and creating new compositions on the fly. And you have one of my favorites, the legendary Pete Tong, who generally eschews the festival scene, preferring to focus on his BBC show, and bringing the newest records and all the classics to the clubs. He knows he's there to drive the dancefloor and show the party people a good time. One of the best sets I've heard recently was his WMC session at Space. He'll actually be on the very same Terrace this coming weekend. I personally can't wait, and I'm at the point know where I'm pretty jaded and it takes a lot to get me excited with regards to DJs.</p>

<p>Maybe that's why I get a kick out of a little party like Jive. It's a bunch of people having a good time and not taking everything so seriously. The cash prize ($200) isn't going to solve world hunger or put a kid through college, so the people participating are usually just up there to have a good time. I think in the end if the rockstar DJs in the world remember that's all people really want, we can get back to some sort of rationality in the dance club scene. It's ironic, the live music scene in general (not just little singing contests in Brickell!) from what I can see is actually getting more down to earth, whereas DJs are getting more and more egotistical in their demands. Even Axl Rose in his prime would be envious of some of these guys' riders. But, from where I sit, I see it as a bubble. I'm confident the DJ world will get back to reality soon.</p>

<p>Oh and a disclaimer, I do sincerely appreciate what some DJs do on and off the decks. Those guys usually end up in my iPhone playlist. I'll post it up someday. I think I do have an audio player plugin. Actually yeah I do. Note to self, start posting some sets of genuinely good DJs. But if any of you dear readers want a good place to start, just hunt out the sets of (in no particular order): Pete Tong, Victor Calderone, Roger Sanchez, The Martinez Brothers, Dennis Ferrer, Danny Tenaglia, Loco Dice, Marco Carola, Oscar G, Patrick M, Mark M (Miami), Trent Cantrelle, the Cocodrills, Louie Vega, Frankie Knuckles, and Eric Prydz to name a few.</p>

<p>I'll try and kick up a favorite mix of mine in the next few days. I gotta see how it will affect my S3 bill. And also if there's anything copyright-related I might have to worry about.</p>
