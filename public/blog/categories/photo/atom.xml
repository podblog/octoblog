<p>It was one of those random "on and off" weekends.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Much like any other mental factor, creativity seems to have a finite supply of sorts, and can be slow to replenish. Thursday, I shot a scenic I'm really proud of, the aptly-titled (yes, I'm totally being narcissistic here) "Where The Buses Don't Run".</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/outwhere_rev-8882.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'US 27 Northbound Broward County'" ></p>

<p>I did this on a Thursday night/Friday morning, and I did the editing and "mastering" work on Friday. When I intend to sell a print, I tend to nitpick. I'll obsess over minute color corrections, lens flares, and wish for things like my print provider accepting TIFF uploads on the off chance there's some minor compression artifacts which could be visible at a large enough print size.</p>

<p>Oh, and by the way, "Out Where The Buses Don't Run" is for sale on my <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">Fine Art America</a> site, along with eight other pieces I consider potential sellers. I'm getting more and more into shooting nighttime scenics. Though I could do without the bugs in the Everglades. There was a mosquito in the 210 on my way home that night. The hardest part was concentrating on keeping steady at 130 km/h while hoping the little bastard would just go away. I did the "open all windows and go even faster" trick and that seemed to help.</p>

<p>That being said, I was fully intent on going back out to shoot more scenics on Friday, but that actually never panned out. I couldn't think of a location to scope out. I might try west this week, now that I think about it.</p>

<p>Saturday was my usual club night over at <a href="http://clubspace.com/">Space</a>. Two of my favorites, Chus + Ceballos, were on hand to provide an extended musical soundtrack to the evening. These guys "get it", they know they are there to keep the crowd moving, and they provide an excellent musical selection over the course of ten or more hours on the decks. Great guys in person, too. They're always game for the photo op, and they actually love to meet their fans. They <a href="http://www.dan-vidal.com/blog/2012/09/06/the-musical-ecosystem/">know their place in the musical ecosystem</a>.</p>

<p>I still have to figure out how to derive that media_id without having to manually kick the Instagram API. If anyone knows how, let me know.</p>

<p>That being said, I definitely had "more creative energy" by that Saturday night. Some plans for early hours didn't materialize. I was supposed to attend a bachelor/bachelorette party at Scarlett's up in Hollywood, but the "confirmation" message never arrived that the people were actually gonna go. By then, it was 1:30 in the morning and I was already framing my mind from staring at desperate girls on the pole to actually doing something productive. So, I kind of said "the hell with it", jumped into a <a href="http://miami.car2go.com/">Car 2 Go</a>, and drove on over to Space.</p>

<p>Car 2 Go is saving me so much money in cab fare. It's amazing. Plus, they never thought of my use case until I told them. They posted on Facebook about using their service to get to the Brickell Oktoberfest party, and taking the safe way (a cab) home. Agalmic cowboy diplomacy.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lostios2012-9217.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Hi Jordyn'" ></p>

<p>Anyways, Space was the usual 'rock' of Miami nightlife this past weekend. Great atmosphere, an interesting crowd, and great music. It's not a trendy VIP club, and it doesn't aspire to be. In my mind it's the heart of Miami nightlife. It is one venue you can go to without even bothering to check their website to see who is playing. A friend of mine suggested that their marketing campaign should be "Space: We're fucking open."</p>

<p>I did my usual rounds at the venue, including switching out to the 50 1.2 L as the morning rolled on. It's a learning curve, but one I'm glad to participate in. It's a great lens and you can do amazing things with it wide open. Every Canon user should have it in their arsenal.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/lostios2012-9335.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Lucy I'm Home'" ></p>

<p>At 1.2, you will have throwaway images. Nature of the beast in a nightclub. Just keep shooting, but don't turn it into a Golden BB spray-and-pray affair. If the shot doesn't happen, it doesn't happen.</p>

<p>I left a little after 9 AM Sunday morning. I woke up Sunday afternoon, since I had a Keys trip planned, but the weather totally did not cooperate. I ended up turning around on the Turnpike Extension after a huge downpour kicked in, with more forecast for Monday. Though Monday turned out to be a rather nice day. Such is luck I guess.</p>

<p>I'll try to make it down again in the next few weeks. Maybe after Halloween Weekend.</p>

<p>Totally random weekend.</p>

<p>If you really want to get out into where it gets dark, you should probably head north and west along US 27 if you live or are shooting in the metropolitan Miami area...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>It's definitely out where the buses don't run.</p>

<p><iframe width="" height="" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/hIv-YaVBtA8 " frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

<p>I miss Miami Vice.</p>

<p>You'll see a bit of the old South Florida when you get out that way. Before the sprawl and the overdevelopment.</p>

<p>This image was done with my 50 1.2 L. So far, so good. I'm definitely happy with the purchase. Prime lenses give you that extra five percent in overall image quality, and the 50 doesn't disappoint in this regard.</p>

<p>This is a 30 second exposure from the side of US 27 heading northbound just over the county line into Broward. There was a small amount of moonlight partially obscured by clouds. The rest is all ambient light, including airglow, the distant Miami city lights, and the lights of passing vehicles.</p>

<p>I'm sure the truckers were wondering what I was doing at 1:30 in the morning on the side of the road. Protip, bring a flashlight, and just point it at the ground when vehicles are coming close.</p>

<p>I'll be putting this one up for sale soon at my <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">FAA</a> site.</p>

<p>Even though I think social networking is mainly a lot of hype, snake oil, and the dumbing down of the narcissistic masses even further, I'll gladly admit my addiction to Instagram. At least to do something meaningful with it, you have to overcome the limitations of your iPhone camera, and go for what's there. It's part of the challenge, to me. Plus, I like the UI and the way it sends your photo while you think of some pithy caption, so it almost appears to upload at warp speed.</p>

<p>There's a trend on Instagram, called "Throwback Thursday". Well, it's Thursday right now. So I like to do throwbacks when I can.</p>

<p>I first saw this when I jumped on Instagram a few months ago. People would post photos from their past, and call them "throwbacks". Now, of course, the limit of the throwback is tied to the age of the image that is being posted. And, most images being posted are straight from a digital source. And unless you were in the photo biz, you had no easy way to digitize your old film shots.</p>

<p>When I shot film, I had a film scanner. Not a flatbed to scan prints, which was essentially making second-generation copies, but a full-on "digital enlarger", which actually had 1/3 the resolution of my current digital SLR, oddly enough. It was a Minolta unit, which actually was old when I bought it, and required me to get an equally-old <em>SCSI</em> (remember SCSI?) adapter card for my homebuilt PC to make it work. It was painfully slow. An average photo session from a club took about 3 hours to scan in if I wanted the proper results.</p>

<p>As time went on, I obviously upgraded to digital (in mid-2003 no less!) with a Canon 10D DSLR. I stowed my Minolta scanner, and actually never touched it again. By the time it occurred to me that maybe I'd want a film scanner to bring back some of those old archived images, it was well past the time when I even had a desktop PC with which it could be used. I had migrated to Apple, and obviously my Macbook had only USB and Firewire ports. Yes, I know Nikon, Imacon, and others make USB and Firewire film scanners, but, economies of scale did not touch them, and they were still as expensive and as rare as the days they were a common item in professional photo labs around the world. There were some cheap brand-X scanners on eBay, but the results were disappointing. And I wasn't about to ship my negatives and chromes to New York, just to have them scanned in. No one is asking for the old stuff for any commercial reasons, anyways, i.e. I couldn't warrant a film scanner purchase just for social media use.</p>

<p>Now, I know what is being asked, "Hey, Pod, didn't you save the files you made from the scans?"</p>

<p>Well, actually I only saved the final JPEG files, which in those days I only saved them at 320 px across in the long dimension to fit the specs for CJ. It wasn't worth saving the TIFF files since if I was printing, I would just do it at the pro lab I worked at at the time on their Frontier system or traditional darkroom. And the only reason to go to TIFF was for archival reasons, and if you had the negs and chromes (which I do), you already had an archive. However, that archive might as well be on the moon as far as quickly accessing it is concerned.</p>

<p>That being said, I did a fun trick for the Tiësto image at the start of this article. That one is from 2002. Nick sent me out to this Nettwerk America record label event at the Aqua Hotel on Collins Avenue, to take photos of "this Tiësto guy", while a writer he drafted interviewed him. Hah, the days of real interviews.</p>

<p>Anyways...what I did to get this "digital" was that I made a pure white block on my Macbook Air's monitor, and laid the chrome of Tijs over it. The white light shines through the chrome, making it visible. Then I used my iPhone camera to take a photo of the chrome laid over the white block. Insta-lightbox-low-res-social-media-scanner. And if you want to do a "scan" of a negative, you just do the same thing, export to Photoshop, invert the colors, do some balancing, and you've got yourself a quick and dirty capture of an old analog image. It's not Imacon quality (but then again, what else is?), but to impress all your friends and mindless followers on Instagram, it's definitely sufficient. A step up would be to rig up your DSLR and do it at a higher resolution. However, then you are picking up the individual elements of the screen unless you have a Retina display. At that point you should probably just secure a lightbox from eBay. Hmm, wait...</p>

<p>Since this blog is partially educational, I'm putting this idea out to the community free of charge. All I ask is if you use this technique, just tag your Instagrams with #podscan and @pod_gram. Attribution is always welcome, and it's what people used to do. Your image and caption can be a throwback!</p>

<p>Happy Throwback Thursday.</p>

<p>I took a little drive around last night to further test and experiment with my new Canon 50 1.2 L.</p>

<p>This time, it was more to test the shallow depth-of-field characteristics at <em>f1.2</em>. Again, at that aperture, your zone of acceptable focus is quite shallow.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/dof-7868.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'E320 W210 50 1.2 L'" ></p>

<p>As you can see here, the hood ornament on my W210 is only partially in focus. The central part of the left spoke is sharp, with the left circular part of the ornament fading into a rather pleasant blur. And the distant background exhibits the smooth bokeh this lens is known for.</p>

<p>Now, this was shot handheld with autofocus engaged. So, this shot is technically a little "off".</p>

<p>At such shallow depths-of-field, every movement counts. If you drift forwards or backwards even slightly, your zone of acceptable focus will change noticeably.</p>

<p>However, this is only noticeable to a great extent when one is doing closeup macro-style shots of objects. The tolerance is a little different at a longer range, as you can see here with this image I took of a <a href="http://miami.car2go.com/">Car2Go Miami</a> Smart Fortwo in Brickell.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/dof-7865.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Car2Go Miami 50 1.2 L'" ></p>

<p>Images like these, at a standoff range, can be done handheld, since the further away you are from your object, the less shallow your zone of critical focus becomes. You can do it handheld, that's for sure. That being said, sometimes it's not always practical to use a tripod. So, the best you can do in these situations is focus manually, and stay very still. Sounds simplistic, but in the case of street photography, you can't really overproduce a shot, in my mind.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/dof-7879.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Street Graffiti Design District Miami 50 1.2 L'" ></p>

<p>The advantage of digital, of course, is that you can take as many images as you need, to get the desired image. This photo below, I initially did with autofocus. Of course, the results were a little off. However, when I manually focused, crouched down, and took three shots in succession, I landed the one I wanted. Not "spray-and-pray" but a small three-frame burst to insure I got what I wanted. Of course the ultimate insurance would have been using my tripod, but at 3 AM in Miami's Design District, breaking out equipment at a grand scale isn't advisable.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/dof_rev-7894.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'W210 Design District Miami 50 1.2 L'" ></p>

<p>Not out of any sense of danger really, but more out of a sense of "It's 3 in the morning and I don't want to rig up a tripod for a test photo..."</p>

<p>So, in a nutshell, if you are going to shoot with this at it's most shallow depth-of-field, I definitely recommend using a tripod, as well as focusing manually, if you are shooting your subject at close range. If you stand off a bit, it becomes less of a problem of course since your zone of acceptable focus becomes correspondingly wider.</p>

<p>But, with these characteristics in mind, the 50 1.2 L is definitely a worthwhile addition to any photographic arsenal. Everyone needs a solid 50mm prime lens, and this is the most solid one in it's class on the market.</p>
