<p>Scroll to the bottom, Instagram appears to be backtracking, or clarifying.</p>

<p>Over the past few days, there's been a bit of a furor over the changed Terms &amp; Conditions over at <a href="http://instagram.com/">Instagram</a>. As an avid user of the service, hell, it's pretty much the only major social media service I don't have a huge dislike for, I was, of course, a little concerned...</p>

<!--more -->


<p><blockquote><p>You agree that a business or other entity may pay us to display your username, likeness, photos (along with any associated metadata), and/or actions you take, in connection with paid or sponsored content or promotions, without any compensation to you.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>This little damning bit of text sent the Instagram community into a tailspin. People cried foul, many cried "copryright!", and more than a few threatened to walk away...but from where I sit today, Instagram is still there, and material is still flowing to it, unabated.</p>

<p>Instagram is a free service. Recently acquired by Facebook, Instagram allows you, the user, to post photos onto their service without charge, and you can even advertise your services and goods through those photos, for free, and Instagram doesn't see a dime of any income you might earn from that advertising. Now, on Instagram you cannot tap on hyperlinks to go to an external website, so in other words, for any external action to be completed, the text must be copied and pasted to your browser. It's not an ideal system. However, considering it's free and easy, it's not to be entirely disregarded. Just don't expect large-scale results from it.</p>

<p>And now, because it is free, Instagram does reserve the right to do whatever they want with the content you post to it, including reselling it. Instagram was purchased by Facebook for a shade under 1 billion US Dollars. That's right, a billion with a <em>b</em>. So, Facebook has to make their money back somehow. One way is by placing ads within the Instagram stream. That's coming soon. Don't be surprised if targeted ads, probably similar to Pandora, make their way into your Instagram feed sometime over the next few months. Also, Instagram will probably be taking photos from their servers, photos that you uploaded, and attempting to resell them on the open market. Fair is fair. Something for something.</p>

<p>And yes, a lot of people are mad about this.</p>

<p>I sure was.</p>

<p>But then I realized a few key things:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Images on Instagram are compressed by the app locally on your phone and uploaded to IG's servers at 612 x 612 pixels, and a fair amount of compression is applied.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><p><a href='/blog/2012/12/18//' data-instagram-url='http://instagr.am/p/TZE207ggNs/' class='instagram-image'><img src='http://distilleryimage4.s3.amazonaws.com/10ba0f9a495411e2b7d622000a1f968a_7.jpg' alt='They can try to use this if they want. #igersmiami #miami #305

<p>This image is one I posted to Instagram just now. It's 612 x 612 at 72 PPI. At print resolution that's maybe 2 inches by 2 inches. Less since I've letterboxed it. Also the image has been clipped and compressed and watermarked. I couldn't see using this for any meaningful print use. This specific copy belongs to Instagram, possibly. And this is as good as it's gonna get off of Instagram.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/vanjee-2031.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Little Car Big Bus'" ></p>

<p>This image is the "web original". It's 960 x 640 at 72 PPI. 3 inches by 2 inches or thereabouts at print resolution. It is compressed as little as possible. However it is watermarked, and it is hosted here, so out and out this "high-quality" version belongs to me. If someone wants to use it or a higher-resolution copy of it, then they need to talk to me (dan at dan dash vidal dot com - if you are of a mind) in order to use it.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Instagram users assume people are interested in their images in order to use them for financial gain.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Fact is, no. To think so is thinking that your content is somehow going to stand out from the billions of images Instagram now plays host to. Even if you are like me, and import your images from a high-quality source, no one with any money to spend on photography or photo licensing is going to care. They know that whatever terms Instagram sets for licensing images will not be in their favor, and also that the quality from Instagram is barely suitable for web use, much less print or any other high-resolution media. 612 x 612 isn't much. Look at it on your monitor. Even if you are on a laptop, the square probably takes up about 1/4th of your screen. Not very meaningful from a compositional perspective. Plus, most IG images are straight from a phone camera and are noisy, overly-contrasted, mushy, and compressed like crazy. Certainly not suitable for reuse or reproduction. Instagram themselves may get some traction out of it, but they are going to find few buyers in the open market for cell phone photos of food.</p>

<p>Sam Biddle over at Gizmodo put it best today:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>This means that Instagram can sell the pictures you take of pineapple upside down cake, latte swirls, and your dumb dog, if some company wants to pay for these photos. They can then do whatever the hell they want with them, including putting the photos in advertisements for shoes or cars or whatever.</p><footer><strong>Sam Biddle</strong> <cite><a href='http://gizmodo.com/5969221/stop-whining-about-your-personal-data-on-instagram-you-little-whiny-baby'>Stop Whining About Your Personal Data on Instagram You Whiny Little Baby</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>And yes, they can and they will try. So be it. And if Instagram can find traction in selling 612 x 612 images, well, good for them. And if it's images I uploaded, well, then I guess there's a market for my images that I post on Instagram. If that's the case I'll be more cautious as to what I post to Instagram, and see about selling 612 x 612 images myself.</p>

<p>A lot of the complainers are making the erroneous assumption that people care what they post. Fact is, most people don't, otherwise they would follow you if they did. Outside of celebrities, most of the world doesn't care about your <em>pineapple upside down cake, latte swirls, and your dumb dog</em> (thanks Sam, that's golden!) or any other aspect of your life. I sure as hell don't. And if I want photos of  pineapple upside down cake, latte swirls, and your dumb dog, I'll take the photos myself of pineapple upside down cake, latte swirls, and your dumb dog.</p>

<p>Keep on Instagramming, I know I will. It's fun, and it's free, and they can only learn about you what you choose to share. Now yes, the theory behind it isn't very good, but in practice there is little actual harm being done. Your Instagram photos are ephemeral snippets of time, not the next iteration of the works of Cartier-Bresson. And if Henri was alive today, he'd have an iPhone (of course) and he'd be Instagramming away with the rest of us. If you don't take Instagram seriously, they won't take you seriously.</p>

<p>But, if you insist, here's a few ways to make your images "unusable".</p>

<ul>
<li>Collage Apps</li>
Collage apps allow you to place multiple images into one Instagram image. My favorite is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/instacollage-pro-pic-frame/id530957474?mt=8">Instacollage Pro</a>. You can post multiple images per Instagram using this, or have one image "broken up" with obnoxious lines going through it. The image up at the top of this article was chopped up in Instacollage Pro.
<li>Use an app like Filterstorm to render the image smaller than the Instagram Square.</li>
The app <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/filterstorm/id363449020?mt=8">Filterstorm</a> is bascially a mini-Photoshop for iOS. You can do basic adjustments and gradings to JPEG images, and there's a handy function called "Make Square" which places a white border around a non-square image, to make it into a square, conveniently in the proportions Instagram needs. This allows a user to display their entire image as intended, and also it makes the image even smaller than 612 x 612, rendering it nigh-unusable for anything but Instagram.
<li>Watermark in Photoshop or Lightroom Right Through The Center</li>
My friend Seth with his company <a href="http://worldredeye.com/">World Red Eye</a> does this with all of his images anyways. It destroys their worth to anyone looking to steal them, regardless of the medium. This is probably the best way of going about it.
</ul>


<p>So yeah, I think I'll keep on Instagramming. I know how to mess up my images just enough to render them useless to anyone looking to use them from Instagram, and also anything I shoot directly with my phone has no significant monetary value.</p>

<p>Follow me at <a href="http://instagram.com/pod_gram">instagram.com/pod_gram</a> - haha!</p>

<p>And yes, I'm aware of the irony of me, the anti-Facebook guy, using Instagram, a Facebook division. There's alternatives out there I'm exploring, don't worry.</p>

<p>Update 2012-12-18 21:03</p>

<p>Instagram appears to be backtracking, according to Kevin's latest <a href="http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening">blog post</a>.
<blockquote><p>Ownership Rights Instagram users own their content and Instagram does not claim any ownership rights over your photos. Nothing about this has changed. We respect that there are creative artists and hobbyists alike that pour their heart into creating beautiful photos, and we respect that your photos are your photos. Period.</p></p><p><p>I always want you to feel comfortable sharing your photos on Instagram and we will always work hard to foster and respect our community and go out of our way to support its rights.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Kevin Systrom</strong> <cite><a href='http://blog.instagram.com/post/38252135408/thank-you-and-were-listening'>Thank You and We're Listening</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>He also goes on to explain that yes, they are a business, and they need to make money. So, for now, it appears that content uploaded to Instagram is safe. I'm not saying Instagram won't change their minds again, or be forced to by Facebook, but at least for now it appears that the more questionable changes to the T&amp;C have been modified and/or clarified. So there's that, and Kevin is a good person for at least speaking out, even if it took the slight threat of a user revolt to do so.</p>

<p>Oh, and happy holidays to my readership. The blog has been a fun adventure over the past few months!</p>

<p>I think I was right, the creative endeavor cannot be forced.</p>

<p>This past evening, I took the 210 out for a small check ride...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Every few months or so, it's a good idea to run fuel system cleaner through your car. Most car nuts agree the only kind worth a damn is <a href="http://techron.com/">Techron.</a> Yes, I know there's <a href="http://www.basf.com/group/corporate/en/brand/KEROPUR">Keropur</a> from BASF, but good luck getting that in anything besides a 55-gallon drum. You can go to any European car dealer, and they should have it, but they'll usually try to rope you in for "service" and flat out not sell you a bottle. And the indie mechanics don't have it since demand is low. So, Techron it is. Daimler actually approves of it, so it's OK.</p>

<p>Anyways, to use a fuel system cleaner, you run your tank low, and then dump a bottle into your tank, and then put 10-15 gallons of gas over that. So, on the way back from the beach today, I swung by the <a href="http://advanceautoparts.com/">Advance Auto Parts</a> shop on Alton, and picked up two bottles. Two because they're running a special - buy one at the normal price, get another for a dollar.</p>

<p>So, I went home, sorted out a few last-minute edits from the weekend, and drove out the last little bit of old gas. I dumped a bottle in, gassed up at the Chevron, and took off for the Turnpike. Why? Well, it might be a bit of a superstition, but M-B enthusiasts over at <a href="http://benzworld.org">Benzworld</a> generally suggest you give your car an "Italian Tuneup" after putting in Techron. Basically an Italian Tuneup is where you find a highway, and just go fast for a bit. Some suggest redlining even, but I'm not going to take that chance. I figured a nice cruise at autobahn speeds would suffice.</p>

<p>So, I got out to the pike and turned it up to around 140 km/h and set the 210 for cruise. That's about 85-90 MPH. Yes, I'm using metric. Just because. It's my blog.</p>

<p>The cruise was great. I had my choice of music on, there was zero traffic, and the flow was smooth. No anomalies.</p>

<p>Eventually, I ended up somewhere near Indiantown Road in Palm Beach County.</p>

<p>After pulling over in a random Publix parking lot and sorting through some emails, I noticed there was a near-full Moon out. I had all my gear on me, so I figured, why not look for some shooting opportunities?</p>

<p>With that in mind, I meandered my way over to Juno Beach proper and onto A1A. The Moon was bright and the cloud cover was breaking up. I didn't intend on shooting anything, but the opportunity was presenting itself. The world fell in line, I may as well capture the results. So, I went out to the beach itself, and captured the wave action by the light of the Moon itself.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/juno-8225.jpg" width="640" height="960" title="'By The Pale Moonlight Vertical - Available Soon For Print'" ></p>

<p>Autofocus and even accurate manual focus via the viewfinder was nigh-impossible. What I did was boosted the ISO to 12800, flipped on Live View, and focused on some waves manually in the distance. And then dropped down to a more reasonable ISO 640 for the actual exposure. The boost in Live View essentially allowed me to have "pseudo-night-vision" and I could gauge the focus on a wave. It worked. The image itself almost appears to be a painting.</p>

<p>Plus, it made me a fan of that specific stretch of Juno Beach. I should get a place up there. It's quiet, and has that sleepy beach-town feeling that I tend to get a kick out of. I like my beach towns to be well, beach towns. South Beach is so not that. It's so bourgeoise (so says the Benz addict, haha!) and overrun with tourists and chain stores. What unique charm it had left ages ago. I could have a bungalow in Juno Beach (or any other quiet beach town in South Florida - they still exist!) and my apt here in Miami. Hmm...</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I'm actually liking what I did tonight. And I didn't even intend on shooting anything. I didn't force the creative process. The world got in line and I captured it...I should stick to my own supposed tagline.</p>

<p>I've got some fine-tuning to do, but the two images featured in this post will be available for sale soon. In the meantime, why not <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com/">click here</a> and browse through what is currently for sale? It's the holidays, someone in your family will need a gift.

<p>Well, it appears I survived the holiday weekend. I'm not one for Black Friday shopping or massive crowds, so I spent Friday itself laying low. I wanted to get out there and "produce" rather than consume, but, nothing major came out of my drivetime adventures either on Friday or Sunday. Which begs the question, can the creative process be forced?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I'm not necessarily talking about paid assignments or tasks, either. When you have a specific framework or set of requirements in mind, it's easy. Take a photo of Bayfront Park for a brochure. We need stock photos of police cruisers lined up. We need a photo of a dog destroying a rug. However, when I set out with a task in mind, such as capturing a nighttime landscape image, occasionally it does lead to a lot of driving around with nothing to show for it. But then, when I least expect it, I'll "land" a great image that I'm proud to show around.</p>

<p>It kind of happened this weekend. I drove around Friday, and Sunday, and didn't generate much in the way of what I considered quality photographic content. Perhaps it was holiday malaise, the phases of the moon, I couldn't really put my finger on it.</p>

<p>Though I did enjoy the exercise at least.</p>

<p>However, in my Saturday club travels, I landed two images which I personally consider presentable material. The first was of Jordyn at Space, as seen above, and the second was of my friend Jane, over at the Vagabond, where I stopped in for <a href="http://djoscarg.net/">Oscar G's</a> and Ralph Falcon's birthday party. Murk boys in effect.</p>

<p>Both images, are obviously "club" images. One of my fortés happens to be nightlife photography, obviously, but as of late, I've been trying to expand my horizons and get away from the familiar pattern of colorfully-lit dancing girls, DJs, fog effects, and crowds. It's fun and I really enjoy it, but I have been trying to expand my repertoire a little bit, i.e. with my landscapes and scenic nighttime photography.</p>

<p>Which begs the question, can the creative process be forced? My two "score" images were generated off-the-cuff, with little technical thought to them. Lights are at <em>x</em>, so shutter speed at <em>y</em>, aperture at <em>z</em>, and ISO at <em>alpha</em>, and press the shutter button. The one of Jane actually had a little more thought to it since I saw the light on the wall and had to position her accordingly, but it wasn't a "planned" image in the sense that I spent time driving around and looking for it. Ms Jane wanted an image, and I gladly provided.</p>

<p>So maybe sometimes "don't think, just shoot" can lead to results as well. I'm definitely digging the end results. Even in the familiar territory of nightlife, I can still pull off a unique composition. And the process wasn't forced. I "had a vision and waited for the world to fall in line...". Maybe trying to force the world to fall in line doesn't work?</p>

<p>And of course having willing subjects helps enormously. Thanks to Jane, and Jordyn as well for participating in my lens antics this weekend.</p>

<p>This past weekend, The Martinez Brothers took to the decks at Space. They've got the youthful energy and enthusiasm in spades. Playing for well over ten hours, they kept the dancefloor moving until the afternoon...</p>

<p>I'm not ancient, by any measure, but by the time I left at 9, I was completely drained...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>And the kids were still rocking it like they just woke up...</p>

<p>Objectively, I'm actually healthier than I've been in a long time. I try to eat right, and take care of myself. I still have a drink or five when I'm at the club (no one trusts you if you are without a drink in a nightclub...just nod and agree with me on this one) and I will be smart and pace myself. However, sometimes I'm just completely drained, even going into Monday. Is it all mental? Or has a decade and change in-scene finally started to catch up with me?</p>

<p>When I was The Brothers' age, I could do a 9-10 hour "shift" standing on my head, and still bounce back for whatever I had to do on Monday. I could even go out multiple nights a week till 5 AM. Now, I don't go to a club unless there's decent money involved. I'd rather relax with friends or just stay home and read/write/edit. Or go out and shoot scenics.</p>

<p>Maybe I am "getting old", who knows? I still enjoy the nightlife, but yeah, it does take a lot out of you, regardless of your health.</p>

<p>For my younger readers - this will happen to you. I can guarantee it. Trick is, pace yourself, but even then...</p>

<p>Maybe a vacation is in order.</p>

<p>One of my favorite DJ/Producers, <a href="http://www.djmarkknight.com/">Mark Knight</a>, stopped in at Space this past weekend for a little eight-hour set on the decks. He's got the idea of being a DJ down pat. He mixes in his own material and edits, with a good dose of anything that will make the crowd move. Throughout the night I heard everything from classic Underworld to even an INXS-inspired white label track. And he's always down for a wacky photo or two, like the one above. And, of course, I get asked 'how did I do that'?</p>

<p>In this case, it wasn't just a random happenstance of the lighting and the photo coming together...</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You have a vision and you wait for the world to fall in line and then you capture it...</p><footer><strong>Adriana D</strong> <cite>A Phone Conversation 12 October 2012</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Generally that is how I work. I wait for things to happen, as I've explained before, then I document it. However, in club life, an interesting 'counter' to my little tagline happens, in that the friendly local lighting techs will set up a specific cue, so I can capture the moment. So, I have to wonder, am I waiting for the world to fall in line if someone kind of knows what I would like to see?</p>

<p>I do appreciate the help, obviously, and it is actually not a hard feat for anyone to accomplish if they are out shooting nightlife. The trick here is, to get to know your light techs and the equipment they employ on a nightly basis.</p>

<p>When I first got started in this, I used to be a part-time light tech for my friend John's sound company. John and I, at the time, were both students over at UM, and to make ends meet, and also for the learning experience (his major was audio engineering), John ran a small sound and lighting company on the side. And I was his unofficial-official light tech, due to my experience with lighting in general, and also no one else in our crew knew the concepts. We didn't get paid much, but at the time, half the fun was just being able to get out there and do shows. We mostly did rock shows, but we also did a few dance-oriented events here and there. Nonetheless, I got to learn the basics of stage and nightclub lighting. As time went on, even after John moved back to Aspen to kick off his <a href="http://alchemyavcs.com/">massive production company</a>, I would stay current and always converse and on occasion, fill in as a tech for a lot of the local guys when they were sick, away or "otherwise indisposed". At this time (early to mid 2000s), lighting was moving from a "dedicated console" world, to a PC-driven sort of affair, especially in the nightclub industry. A $300 PC and $700 USB-DMX widget could take the place of a $20000 console in a nightclub setting. The most popular product was <a href="http://martinpro.com/product/product.asp?product=lightjockey">LightJockey</a> by Martin. In a nutshell, after you installed and connected all your fixtures, you used this piece of software and supplied USB-DMX widget, and could program and control your lightshow from any commodity PC. It is all very graphical.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/LJ.jpg" width="600" height="474" title="'Lightjockey 2.0'" ></p>

<p>There's several competing software packages out there nowadays, but Lightjockey is the most common one. The concepts are the same though.</p>

<p>And then, obviously, beyond the controller, is the entire world of the lighting fixtures themselves. Common manufacturers include <a href="http://martinpro.com/">Martin</a>, <a href="http://www.highend.com/">Highend</a>, <a href="http://www.elationlighting.com/">Elation</a>, <a href="http://claypaky.com/">Clay Paky</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>Entire blogs and sites are devoted to lighting. Obviously this one isn't. But, you don't have to be a light tech to speak the basics. The key, I've found, is to know what the fixtures are (spots, washes, scanners, strobes - all kind of self-explanatory), and the right terms for what the fixtures do (If you say 'CTO' you'll usually be taken a little bit more seriously) and what the colors and filters are, and also the basics of how a lighting scene is constructed. Also, if you don't know the tech, get to know him or her (yes, her - one of the best in the biz <a href="https://www.facebook.com/miss.allegra"> is a girl</a>.) and develop a rapport. If it's early in the night, the tech is usually just running through the motions, and will probably be up for a break in the routine. Use the opening DJ as a "practice target", and get some cues set up for yourself.</p>

<p>Now, this all kind of reeks of cheating. And, maybe it is. However, the way I can ethically justify it is now, in a lot of places, the tech will actually bring up "my" cues, without me even asking. At Space, I don't think I've asked Dennis or Gabriel for a specific cue in months. It just all falls into place. They know what will make for a great image, and more importantly, when to deploy those cues, for maximum effect on both the crowd and my image capture. We work together on it.</p>

<p>Plus, a good tech will know the flow and rhythm to the music and crowd, and having specific cues becomes less and less necessary, since the lighting will just happen. When a song peaks, you know there will be a sizable amount of strobing, for example. Or when there is a lull in the track, it could go dark, or a nice blue wash from the Platinum Beams will kick in.</p>

<p>Of course, the assumption being made here is that you are shooting in a venue that is equipped with a decent lighting rig, and, beyond that, a dedicated lighting technician. Some smaller venues still run their lighting systems on autopilot, or according to a preset schedule (Lightjockey allows for scheduled cues based on the time of day, even), depending on the needs of the venue. That being said, most places of that nature actually have a lot of practical lighting, or a good dose of ambient light. There's a lot of light out there if you know where to find it.</p>

<p>But, if the situation allows for it, definitely get to know and work with the light techs in a venue, the resultant images will be much more "meaningful" than your usual run-of-the-mill flash-and-dash captures.</p>
