    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/pete-5469.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Jordyn on the box at Space'" ></p>

<p>Sometimes when I think about what to put here too much, I'm at a loss. I can't force myself to write. Usually, when I drop an article in here, it's in relation to something I've done, read, or saw. This blog is very reactive and not proactive right now, I guess. This post is definitely reactive.</p>

<p>A few minutes ago, I read a blog entry by local shooter <a href="http://helloimscott.com/">Scott Alexander</a> on how he's burnt out on his primary subject, erotica and fetish, but not for the reasons you would think.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In the <a href="http://helloimscott.com/2012/09/adapting-new-battle-strategies/">blog post</a>, he sums it up eloquently:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>But it’s more than just being burnt out from this business. It’s so many different things. I tire of people looking at me sideways or making assumptions about me and my life. I tire of the judgement. I tire, when meeting someone new, that because someone else has said something to them, they’ve already made up in their mind what I’m all about and don’t even TALK to me with any kind of respect. I tire of not being taken seriously.</p><footer><strong>Scott Alexander</strong> <cite><a href='http://helloimscott.com/2012/09/adapting-new-battle-strategies/'>Adapting New Battle Strategies</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>In a nutshell (correct me if I'm wrong Scott), it seems he is tired of being judged as a smut-peddler, when there's so much more to what he does.</p>

<p>Now, to a lesser extent, I encounter this on occasion when I talk to people about what I do, regardless of whether I meet them inside or outside of the club environment. Without sounding pretentious I like to think that I put my own spin on the images I capture. Since I have the luxury (haha) of running my own site, I have complete freedom to capture the images how I want them. Of course, I have to make some concessions with the client (that is why you will see photos that look like "typical" club shots), but I do have the flexibility to shoot what I want as well.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I can do that is the amount of time I've been rattling around Miami's club scene, which, by my watch, is around 15 years at this point. That's an eternity. I've been around longer than almost every venue in town, and most promoters and DJs. I got started in this when the post of 'club photographer' was a rare thing. And since it was rare, I was able to set the tone for myself, i.e. I wasn't under the gun to shoot 100000 images of drunk girls, and as time went on, even the people who wanted me to do so, ended up conceding, or moving on to someone who would shoot 10000 images of drunk girls.</p>

<p>In a nutshell that explains why I'm not rich off of photography and have to do web-related odd jobs to pay for things. Making money from producing just the photos (or any art for that matter) you want is extremely challenging.</p>

<p>In this modern era, I would probably not be able to score a single club-related photo gig if I was starting out. Simply because there's too many people/sites willing to shoot 10000 drunk-girl images for cheap, and almost zero demand for any sort of artistry in the photos captured. Nightclubs just want photos for social network promotion. And hey, they're running a business, and it costs an obscene amount of money to run it. FYI, a large nightclub costs around $30,000 a night sans DJ fees just to operate! So yeah, they kind of need people to show up.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I've got work via my veteran status and longtime connects, but if I had to do it all over again today (with the same eye/mindset), I probably wouldn't do it at all.</p>

<p>However, many would and are doing it. They will shoot 10000 photos a night of drunk girls with their cameras on "P" or green mode. Fire away, give 'em the little card, and move on to the next target. And annoy the DJ while they are at it.</p>

<p>And unfortunately, since this type of photographer is ubiquitous to the club scene, I'm sometimes lumped into the same mold as they are. Much as Scott is probably lumped into the same mold as whomever does the shooting for Bangbus, even though their material is worlds apart.</p>

<p>I see it sometimes, when people ask me what I shoot, and I try my best to sugarcoat it. "Yes, I shoot special events, concerts, and nightlife...". Which basically means I spend time taking photos in loud, hot, smoky rooms filled to the gills with drunk people.</p>

<p>However, even in those loud, smoky, drunk rooms, there's ample opportunity to compose and capture aesthetically pleasing images. The image up top is one example.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ldw-4558.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Jordyn again - yes, I shoot her a lot'" ></p>

<p>This would be another. In my humble opinion, this isn't a side of nightlife that people normally notice. And I like to capture that, to show those rare moments when something visually amazing happens for a split second, in a place most people consider just a loud, hot, smoky, drunk room.</p>

<p>It's why I carry sample images on my iPhone of what I'm able to do. If I can hold someone's attention for five seconds before they run away, since they judge me as being "That guy with the camera in the club...", I usually show them just what I mean. Then their opinions change.</p>

<p>However, on occasion the whole issue does get tiring. Which is why I've branched out into shooting scenics recently. Now, it's not to force myself to shoot something I don't like. I really do like scenics. On occasion in the past I've shot some rather stunning ones. But nowadays, I've actually begun to market myself as being able to do that as well. The nice thing is, I'm able to spring that as a surprise on the unsuspecting critic.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/bridge-4199_blog.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Islamorada Crossing'" ></p>

<p>Plus it's pretty relaxing. I actually took this photo and then just sat down under the bridge for an hour afterwards.</p>

<p>This last piece has actually sold a few copies over on my <a href="http://dan-vidal.fineartamerica.com">FAA page</a>. And when I show it to a critic who lumps me in with the likes of the unscrupulous run-and-gun shooters, they usually get quite embarrassed.</p>

<p>However, even if they do walk away, I don't mind. I still find enjoyment in shooting nightlife and events. The varied situations, the challenge of shooting in dark rooms, the dynamics, and getting to see some friends of mine all contribute to that, even after fifteen years. The burnout feeling comes and goes, but for the most part, it goes. Sometimes when I want to just stop, I'll find some glimmer (no kids, 'glimmer' is not the name of a new drug!) that keeps me going. Aside from the fact that I can't argue with the money, of course.</p>

<p>I'll be at Space tonight/tomorrow morning around 3 AM for one of the few good DJs left in the scene, Roger Sanchez. If anyone from here reads this and is there, come and say hello. I'll explain more in detail time permitting.</p>

<p>Scott, if you're reading, don't take any guff from those swine. You've got a great body of work, and it speaks for itself. If anything drop on them your collection from driving across the country and back on a scooter. That was amazing.</p>

<p>Sidebar: I drove across the country once. It was in a moving van equipped with an first-gen iPad 3G, 3 diverse smartphones, a cooler full of rations, and spares for everything. Halfway through I wanted to blow up the moving van and take my camera backpack, iPad, and some clothes and go buy a cheap scooter and finish the ride that way by going the scenic route. I'm gonna figure out how to make these sidebars on the side, soon.</p>

<p>iOS 6 allows iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 users to take panoramas using the native Camera App. It's kinda cool.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p></p>

<p>I'm actually very impressed with the results, considering it's generated with the camera inside of a phone. There's noise and so forth, but as a quick "live" panoramic tool, it is great.</p>

<p>Yes, I'm aware apps exist that do this anyways on both iOS and Android, but this functionality baked in, as it were, is pretty nifty. It also allows for smoother integration in terms of sending out via email or social media.</p>

<p>Now, even more so, the death of the pocket camera is imminent. An iPhone can take awesome images, as well as being a general-purpose pocket computer/communicator. The market in cameras will define itself by three tiers:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>DSLRs</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Pretty much what you see today. Digital still/video cameras with their roots in film SLRs, with the same accessories and lens systems.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Compact "rangefinder" style cameras.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Small bodies with or without interchangeable lenses with a large sensor. Think of the Sony NEX line or Canon's EOS-M. You'll see pros pick these up as a secondary or a "stealth" camera. And well-heeled hobbyists who want a nice system but without the bulk of a DSLR.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Cameras built into smartphones and tablets.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The iPhone 4s and the forthcoming iPhone 5 cameras are superb. Except for the flash function, it still sucks. But if you know what you are doing, who needs flash? There's apps that allow full manual control of the cameras, too. So there's your pocket camera solution.</p>

    <link href="http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/08/wynwood-artwalk-too-hot-to-handle/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-08T23:16:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/08/wynwood-artwalk-too-hot-to-handle</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/artwalk.jpg" width="960" height="960" title="'Artwalk Wynwood Artwalk Miami'" ></p>

<p>Though I guess I could be considered part of the Miami art community, I almost never go to Artwalk in Wynwood. I'm usually busy Saturday nights, or I consider my rare downtime more valuable than bouncing from gallery to gallery, most of which probably wouldn't exhibit anything I do. Photography is sort of underrepresented at Artwalk, but that's for another rant.</p>

<p>So anyways, the rare times I go to it are last-minute call-ups like I did earlier tonight.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I got a text from my good friend <strong>Emi Guerra</strong>, he wanted to go out and cruise Artwalk and meet some of the Miami art community to tell them about his forthcoming <strong>UR1 Festival</strong>, the big music and art festival taking place on December 8th and 9th during Art Basel. The big announcement of the lineup is Monday, even though it has been leaked. So I won't post it here since you can find it <a href="http://forum.talknightlife.com/">elsewhere.</a>.</p>

<p>But anyways, he wanted to go out and see the artists and art people. Makes sense if you are throwing an art-oriented festival. And, since I'm kinda in touch with these people (am I?) he invited me along.</p>

<p>So, I jumped into the 210 and zipped on down Biscayne to Wynwood.</p>

<p>Once I got to the area, what a bloody mission. Traffic was at a gridlocked standstill, and there were throngs of people out and about, to the point where Northwest 2nd Avenue was a pedestrian thoroughfare. I was supposed to meet Emi and his UR1 team at Wynwood Walls, and I ended up having to park about seven blocks away. I'm a healthy boy now so it's no big deal, but it's the principle. And I will not valet. The 210 isn't an SLS or an E 63, but it's my baby and no one except me and the crew at <a href="http://masterclassauto.com/">Masterclass Auto</a> touches the steering wheel.</p>

<p>Some have called for the major streets of Wynwood to be closed off to automotive traffic during Artwalk. 100 percent, yes. Please. Do this. Commissioner Sarnoff, it's your district (for now), make it happen. The cops have their hands full pushing vehicular and pedestrian traffic around, and it's a complete cluster down there, and it actually hampers the enjoyment of Artwalk.</p>

<p>So yes, Artwalk has truly exploded into a Miami social phenomenon. We officially have an art scene here as far as I'm concerned. Go us.</p>

<p>However, I finally did get situated, and met Emi, along with UR1's Jackie Richie, Emi's assistant Andrea, Alex Martinez of <a href="http://deepsleepstudio.com">Deepsleep</a>, and a few other scene people I know at Wynwood Walls, which was "at capacty" and had this weird dining area with a velvet rope and such set up.</p>

<p>They gotta update the artwork there. It's been the same since I last went to Artwalk (oddly enough with Emi's brother, Eddy) over two years ago. I'll paint a wall. It won't be anything "arty", but it will be something from my mind. I'll mention it here even.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, everyone was out in force. Now, was everyone into the art? Hardly. Most people "Artwalking" couldn't tell you if that was a piece by Nagelbett or Britto. They are out for the social experience. Emi phrased it best when he said, "They are out for something to do, and it's cheap to go to Artwalk. Shit is expensive these days..."</p>

<p>He hit the nail on the head. Shit is expensive these days. Dinner for two will run you $100 or more. A night out at a club, even Space, will run you $100 per person (drinks, cover, and so on) or more if you VIP it. Having fun costs money!</p>

<p>But not at Artwalk. The galleries often have cash bars and/or free (albeit low-quality) booze on hand. They usually arrange a sponsorship or something. And the food trucks are out in force, and the food is cheap, though I wouldn't necessarily trust it. Yeah, the modern food trucks have all the amenities, but it's still a food truck, ya know? We called 'em the "roach coaches" back in Jersey. Note to food truck owners, I'm not saying that your food truck has roaches. If you're that concerned about what I said, you probably have something to hide. Be confident in your product and people talking shit, like me, won't affect your business. Let freedom ring.</p>

<p>But yes, anyways, people are out for Artwalk because it's cheap, interesting, and there's a good social dynamic. And the galleries and artists put up with it since it will get their works exposed to the five percent of the people who actually know their art and are in a position to do something about it.</p>

<p>And yes, please block off the streets. Artwalk is now truly a "phenomenon" and it needs to be handled properly. Our art scene is finally getting some worldwide respect, and it'd be a shame if logistical squabbles killed off a major component of it.</p>

<p>Maybe I should run for the City Commission and make Artwalk one of my campaign platforms...</p>

<p>Sidebar: Yes, I'm aware the issues mentioned here are old. But these first few articles on my blog are kind of for SEO purposes, as well as stuff that is on my mind, regardless of when it happened. It's my blog, after all.</p>

<p>Sidebar 2: Yes, this devolved into a rant. In a nutshell, I did have fun at Artwalk. The food truck area is a great concept. Get 'em all in one place. Also, good seeing the <a href="http://car2go.com/">Miami Car2Go</a> people out...thanks for the T-shirt guys.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[On the premise of exclusivity]]></title>
    <link href="http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/on-the-premise-of-exclusivity/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-06T19:12:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.dan-vidal.com//blog/2012/09/06/on-the-premise-of-exclusivity</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ex.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'MK II overlooking Space'" ></p>

<p>Over the years, a lot of people have been under the mistaken assumption that I've been the "exclusive" photographer for venues and events I've worked with.</p>

<p>I don't enforce or expect exclusivity, and here's why...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At the root of it all, I'm only one person. I can only be in so many places within a venue at once, especially if it's a large scale venue such as Space. I'll be upstairs on the Terrace, but the Loft might be uncovered, or the Ballroom. There isn't money in the budget to clone me.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that photographers prior to me didn't enforce exclusivity with their venue clients was an enormous boost to me being able to do what I do today. If they hadn't left that door open, I might not have been as far along as I am today. However, back when I got started, the position/gig of "club photographer" was a rare one indeed. More on that in a minute.</p>

<p>And, if I were a large-scale venue manager/owner, and I had it in the budget, I would definitely want multiple photographic perspectives on what was going on that evening. Each and every person who picks up a camera has their own thoughts and ideas on how an image should come out, and it is a definite advertising boon to have those multiple perspectives represented. And in the case of email-harvesting sites posing as photo sites, the venue gets multiple sources of data. I don't necessarily approve of the tactic, but it is what it is, and if I were a venue owner or manager, I would avail myself of a few of those sites.</p>

<p>Finally, to be honest, enforcing exclusivity and being "the guy" is a real <em>pain</em>. You're expected to be everywhere at once, cover the event exactly in the style the client wants, which may not be your style, and the task of club photographer rapidly turns from a fun profession to a "job", i.e. something you have to do to make money. And, frankly, I can think of many healthier activities that aren't fun to do at all, that would earn me the same money or more that I do documenting the nightclub scene. I do it primarily because I love to do it, and the financial benefits are just the icing on the cake. You don't see people clamoring to spend thousands of dollars on camera equipment just to take it into a smoke-filled room with loud music and sloppy drunk people because it's a job.</p>

<p>However, the situation today could be regarded as a little different. Since I got started, the position of club photographer has gone from a rare job description, to one of almost ubiquity. Often, the last thing a party would consider is booking a photographer to document an event. It was usually a "6 PM on the night of the event" request, if they thought about it at all. Of course the internet changed that.</p>

<p>Now, if you throw a party at a club, it's expected that you will have at least one or two guys on hand to document the event. However, some venues tend to go a little overboard, thinking any exposure is good, and let any guy with an SLR and an excuse into the venue. With the modern set of circumstances in mind, I'd at least require that the shooter have a full-fledged website (and not just a Facebook page or Flickr gallery) with which their images were to be posted. And, I'd probably cap the amount of shooters within a venue to a certain amount to avoid "shooting gallery" syndrome where there is, in fact, ten or more shooters in a venue. So, exclusivity on one person, not so much, but not overkill like some places are now. Especially if you add in everyone with their iPhones blazing away. But that's for another rant.</p>

<p>If you're in the club shooting world, keep shooting. Don't expect or enforce exclusivity though, it's not practical and definitely not in the spirit of things. There's enough subject matter for all (well, most) of us.</p>
