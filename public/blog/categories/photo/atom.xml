<p>Sorry about the dearth of updates over the past few days. The wedding edit took some time, as well as real-life things having to happen as well. And then Halloween. The biggest, most interesting challenge, however, was the selection and deployment of a web application to display the edited photos from Tal and Erick's wedding...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The edit itself went flawlessly. With my MacBook Air being a completely solid-state system, the actual rendering and editing took no time at all. Any time spent was purely on creative decisions. Protip - double-check that your sensor is clean. Cloudless blue skies make for wonderful wedding backdrops, but every little dust particle shows up. And the ultrasonic cleaner will not get them all. I spent a good amount of time spotting each photo. I usually check my sensor, but my MK II has the cleaning system, so I thought nothing of it. Wrong. Dust still adheres to the sensor surface.</p>

<p>I teased the bride and groom with little Instagram previews of my progress. It was a photo of a photo, but they got a kick out of it.</p>

<p><p><a href='/blog/2012/10/23//' data-instagram-url='http://instagr.am/p/RJTU0XAgCa/' class='instagram-image'><img src='http://distilleryimage2.s3.amazonaws.com/ba2799ba1d7311e2959322000a1e9e0c_7.jpg' alt='Your turn in the render render @simply_sarah7' height='612' width='612' /></a><br/>Filtered with <a href='/blog/categories/normal'>Normal</a> through <a href='/blog/categories/instagram'>Instagram</a></p><!--more--><p><a href='http://maps.google.com?q=25.835181305,-80.182557106'><img border='0' src='http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=25.835181305,-80.182557106&markers=25.835181305,-80.182557106&zoom=14&size=612x200&sensor=false' alt='Talk Nightlife' /></a><br/>Taken at Talk Nightlife</p><p class='instagram-comment-holder'><a href='https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=082223ce4af44db2a4b0440fd98957c9&redirect_uri=http://www.dan-vidal.com/#access_token=31120127.082223c.33c03a5584f54c3494027e191a8d7b73&response_type=token&scope=likes+comments' id='308863042945417370_31120127' class='instagram-comment-link'>Sign in with Instagram to view Likes and Comments</a></p></p>

<p>Finally, I completed the edit, and then had to tackle the task of how best to display the photos.</p>

<p>Now, the obvious solution would have been to just use a canned solution like Flickr, or 500 px. While both services have their strong points, the fact that I don't have direct control over my content did give me cause for concern. Plus, with my recent forays into the world of building web applications and coding, I wanted to roll my own solution as much as possible.</p>

<p>Initially, I wanted to present the site via Octopress. I have experience in Octopress now, because of this blog, and several photo display plugins have been written for the platform.</p>

<p>I had done some research, and found that the web app <a href="http://fancyapps.com/fancybox">Fancybox</a> integrated somewhat smoothly with Octopress. Also, a fellow Octopress user, <a href="http://tritarget.org/blog/2012/05/07/integrating-photos-into-octopress-using-fancybox-and-plugin/">Tritarget</a> had written a pretty good plugin which made the display of photos even easier, since it utilized simple Markdown tags, rather than coding raw HTML.</p>

<p>To make things easy, and not interfere with the operation of this blog, I chose to spin up another instance on my <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> account. Heroku is the ideal choice for this and other projects of mine because I can spin up as many instances as I want, and only accrue charges for the total amount of resources (regardless of the number of apps) that I consume. After a little tweaking and adjustments, I got Fancybox and the plugin to play nice with Octopress.</p>

<p>Fancybox is probably the best-looking HTML-based photo display app out there. Slick transitions, a great UI, and easy implementation (mostly), make for a great quick-and-dirty display solution. However, the downside is, there is no practical way, that I found, to do a "gallery". And a gallery was needed since my final edit came to 530 photos.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/preview_collage.jpg" width="960" height="960" title="'Previews'" ></p>

<p>And I certainly wasn't going to manually input the Markdown tags for 530 photos. So, with that in mind, I decided to divest my thoughts of using Octopress. I set out to find a dedicated photo display solution. Some enterprising individuals had written plugins which can read Flickr sets, but I didn't want to host on Flickr, for copyright and personal reasons. So, I googled around a bit and found several Rails-based photo gallery apps.</p>

<p>Now, some of you may ask, why wouldn't I just use the Rails-based photo gallery app that I had already, i.e. <a href="http://seenightlife.com/">See Nightlife</a>?</p>

<p>Well, to be honest, See Nightlife is broken. I can upload and display, but all organizational tools are offline. It's a "write once" solution as it stands. I can't even delete photos. Also, Ryan and I simply haven't had the time to fix it. Plus, the app it was based on, <a href="https://github.com/rapind/albumdy">Albumdy</a> is no longer being maintained.</p>

<p>As this was to display the wedding photos of two of my closest friends, something a little more reliable needed to be found. These are wedding photos, not a bunch of images of kids blindly worshipping some guy playing music off of his Mac.</p>

<p>So, with that in mind, I settled on a fairly popular Rails app called <a href="http://balderapp.com/">Balder.</a></p>

<p>Developed and maintained by Espen Antonsen out of Norway, Balder is a currently-maintained-and-produced Rails app for displaying photos in a collection/album format. And it fit my use case perfectly, as I wanted to host my photos on S3, and have the app live on Heroku. Heroku is more for running applications, and not storage. S3 is eminently more suited to storage, hence "Simple Storage Service" (S3). Espen himself uses this setup, and even provided a howto guide <a href="http://blog.inspired.no/rails-photo-gallery-balder-on-heroku-and-s3-726/">on his blog</a> on how to do it. In a nutshell, you provide Balder your S3 key, secret, and bucket name in a config file, commit to Heroku, and go from there. The one stumbling block I encountered is that the uploader itself tries to call an EXIF display module, which is dependent on a UNIX executable, which to my knowledge, cannot be installed on Heroku. So, even though the initial deployment was fast, the actual implementation wasn't.</p>

<p>Now, where the virtues of open source kick in is that I had the code for Balder on my local machine. Through Heroku's logging, I could see where the app was breaking uploads. I'm still a 'babe in the woods' when it comes to coding, but I can read what the code is doing. I saw where it was getting hung up, but had no idea on how to fix it, or comment it out, since I specifically didn't need EXIF data to be displayed. For those who may not be familiar, EXIF data is basically metadata contained in a JPEG file, which shows things like the camera type, exposure settings, and so on. You can see the EXIF data of a photo by doing the "File Info" function on your operating system of choice.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/exif.png" width="964" height="541" title="'Coding'" ></p>

<p>So, via the <a href="https://github.com/espen/balder">issues tracker in the Github repository for Balder</a>, I submitted a request for support from the developer. Now, since the app is free, and Espen derives no income from it, he was under zero obligation to respond to me. Since it was the weekend, I didn't expect much right away. But, by this morning, he had filed a response to my request:</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>Try commenting out "before_create :exif_read" in the photo model. I will look into this later but currently too busy with other work.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>Espen Antonsen</strong> <cite><a href='https://github.com/espen/balder/issues/36'>HTML5 Uploader Generates HTTP Error</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I appreciated his honesty, that's for sure. Way more than I expected. Most free open-source projects are one-shot deals where the developer does the initial work, and then forgets about it. So, I was pleasantly surprised at a reply.</p>

<p>And fortunately, his solution worked. I commented out a call to the non-existent EXIF module, and successfully uploaded some photos as a test. After confidently seeing that they displayed and cycled according to my wishes, I then began to upload the wedding photos in earnest. Balder has an excellent organizational structure. I can create a collection, let's call it "Wedding", and then albums for each portion of the event. Very slick. Five stars. And wonderful support from someone whom isn't even obligated to do so.</p>

<p>Now, if this was a closed-source solution or a problem with a hosted service like Flickr, I would have had no way of figuring out what was wrong. I would have had to email their support, wait, and hope they could get to the issue in time. With open-source, I can peek under the hood, make some educated assessments as to what the issue is, and attempt a fix on my own. Or at the least, get concrete info that the developer understands so he or she can make a more effective fix. Plus, I got to learn a little more about just what makes a Rails-based web app tick.</p>

<p>Right now, the app is deployed to Heroku, and running smoothly. I plan on using Balder in general, from here on out and whenever possible for my hosting needs. Open source for the win, as they say.</p>

<ul>
<li>Sidebar: I'd love to show you guys the results of the wedding, but since it was a personal affair, I would rather receive clearance before I share the results with the public. Thanks for understanding, all.</li>

<p>You definitely can't argue with the sunsets on the Outer Banks of North Carolina.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Sure, sunset photos are contrived and "have been done", but sometimes, regardless of your skill level, every photographer needs to shoot a few "typical" images. If anything, for those of us who take ourselves too seriously, you can justify it as a "test" or "calibration" or "comparison".</p>

<p>Besides, it's rather nice-looking.</p>

<p>I think in terms of "a place to go to do nothing", Emerald Isle has Key West beat. There is absolutely nothing going on but the weather. No clubs, no bars, just some pretty pricey real estate and people just kicking back. You have to bring your own fun, essentially. Which was kind of nice.</p>

<p>A huge congratulations to my friends and neighbors Talmage and Erick on their wedding this past weekend. We all went up to Emerald Isle, NC for the ceremony. It was pretty spectacular.</p>

<p>I don't explicitly advertise myself as a wedding photographer. While I know it can be lucrative, I've also heard a lot of horror stories from other shooters about the stress involved, and not just from bridezillas either...</p>

<p>But I don't turn down weddings that come my way...</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Typically, a wedding will come my way about once a year. It's always through a friend or acquaintance. And, for the most part, they know how I shoot when they hire me. They know that I'm definitely not a wedding photography specialist.</p>

<p>The wedding I shot this past weekend with Tal and Erick was a great example. I've known Tal since about 2004 through the club scene and her being a poster on TNL, and Erick for a little bit longer than that. They both knew my specialties in terms of photography. But, they also wanted a distinct look and feel for their photos, and also the obvious of preferring to hire a friend rather than someone they didn't know.</p>

<p>For me, it was an opportunity to change things up a bit in terms of my photo work, and an excuse to rent some quality equipment and maybe try some new concepts.</p>

<p><p><a href='/blog/2012/10/19//' data-instagram-url='http://instagr.am/p/Q_FrW8ggJe/' class='instagram-image'><img src='http://distilleryimage6.s3.amazonaws.com/d13ac15c1a5511e29c6822000a1f9688_7.jpg' alt='Tele for @talmagelisabeth wedding.' height='612' width='612' /></a><br/>Filtered with <a href='/blog/categories/normal'>Normal</a> through <a href='/blog/categories/instagram'>Instagram</a></p><!--more--><p><a href='http://maps.google.com?q=34.682976,-76.912536'><img border='0' src='http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=34.682976,-76.912536&markers=34.682976,-76.912536&zoom=14&size=612x200&sensor=false' alt='Best House At The Biotch' /></a><br/>Taken at Best House At The Biotch</p><p class='instagram-comment-holder'><a href='https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=082223ce4af44db2a4b0440fd98957c9&redirect_uri=http://www.dan-vidal.com/#access_token=31120127.082223c.33c03a5584f54c3494027e191a8d7b73&response_type=token&scope=likes+comments' id='305988269492011614_31120127' class='instagram-comment-link'>Sign in with Instagram to view Likes and Comments</a></p></p>

<p>My loadout for the wedding started as a grandiose idea in my head. Since my "gift" to them was essentially my work (only thing I asked for was transport and lodging), I wanted to make it shine. However, since I'm a one-man show here, eventually less was more. My final kit was:</p>

<ul>
<li>5D MK II - primary body</li>
<li>50D - backup body</li>
<li>580 EX Speedlite</li>
<li>580 EX II Speedlite from <a href="http://lensrentals.com/">Lens Rentals</a>.</li>
<li>16-35mm 2.8 L zoom lens</li>
<li>50mm 1.2 L prime lens</li>
<li>70-200 2.8 II L zoom lens</li>
<li>2 Fong Lightspheres from <a href="http://lensrentals.com/">Lens Rentals</a></li>
<li>ST-E2 Speedlite transmitter</li>
<li>2 32 GB CF cards</li>
<li>Joby Gorillapod</li>
<li>The Podbook Air</li>
<li>A GoPro Hero 2 from <a href="http://weekendweapons.com/">Travis</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>And even then this was heavy. That's a lot of glass and accessories to haul with you.</p>

<p>I was there primarily in a still-photography capacity, however, I did want to shoot some video too. A mutual friend, Pat Theodore, was on video duty with his Nikons, but I offered to throw in whatever I got with the GoPro and my MK II into the mix.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the one variable that I could not control cooperated. The weather was amazing.</p>

<p>The Emerald Isle weather gods were definitely with us that day. And the wedding was planned to be right around sunset.</p>

<p>The true challenge of the wedding really wasn't on a technical level for me. I was shooting at golden hour, on the beach, with people I know and get along famously with. The real challenge was on an organizational level. As I was the only still shooter for the wedding, I had my hands full, even with a small party (around 30 people), such as this one. I can see now why full-time wedding shooters, always have a second person with them. I got the photos I wanted, and then some, but it was definitely a few minutes of sheer intensity as I scrambled around to get the images. The biggest savior was definitely the 70-200. From a practical standpoint, the lens enabled me to get "the" key images of the actual vows portion of the ceremony, without being on top of the bride and groom. I also utilized one of the 580s I had with me as a remote light. I used the Gorillapod to strap it to the "altar" framework and put it on a secondary channel which I clicked over to as I needed it. I ended up not really using it, but it was nice to have on hand. And I had the GoPro running as a continuous record of the ceremony. I wonder how that came out...</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/tal-3107.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'In close but not'" ></p>

<p>And, one can definitely not argue with the virtue of having someone trained in makeup on hand. One of Tal's friends, Kristin, along with Michelle T, handled that duty. Sure, brides have to look their best, but us behind the lens appreciate it too. A well-done makeup job saves us enormous amounts of time later. Tal has a natural glow to her anyways, but the makeup job will be saving me hours of time in post production this coming week.</p>

<p>Now, where the ceremony was mainly, from a technical perspective, about the 70-200, the candids at the reception back at the beach house were all about going wide, and using my 50 1.2 L. While not a nightclub setting, the lighting was darker and variable, and I wanted to get some "candids" like they expected out of me. And the 50 came through, especially later, when someone (not gonna say who!) decided to set off some heavy-duty fireworks in celebration of the happy couple.</p>

<p>That being said, it was definitely a great departure from my norm in terms of shooting. I probably bought a little more equipment than I really needed to for this specific ceremony, but, it is best to be overprepared than under. And, a wedding is one situation where you definitely need to make the client aware of whether you are there for stills, or video. I grabbed some video as time permitted, but I didn't make it a priority. I had the GoPro with me mainly as an experiment, and anything out of the MK II was when the moment became rather static.</p>

<p>After this experience, I can say I do have more of an appreciation for what full-time wedding shooters do. It's a tough job, even if you know the people involved. Would I get into wedding photography full-time? Well, only if I could get a gig like this past one on a regular basis. I'm not too sure if I'd be down for a full-on church-and-500-family-members-and-freeloaders style ceremony.</p>

<p>But, more importantly, congrats once again to Talmage and Erick. You guys rock. I'll have your custom site and edits sorted probably around the time you get in from Captiva...</p>

<p>It was a positively stunning day here in South Florida, so I jumped in the 210 and went out for a bit.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I made my usual Saturday stop at Whole Foods, this time the South Beach one. The Aventura one has better wraps, but the Beach one is closer, and I wanted to shoot some random stuff on the Beach anyways.</p>

<p>After my tuna wrap, I proceeded up Collins to the Ocean Terrace around 74th Street. I figured I'd try to get some shallow DOF shots out on the sand. I was experimenting with trying to capture one breaking wave, when an orange can thumped into my foot.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/niceday-1476.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'Mirinda'" ></p>

<p>"Mirinda?" I thought, "What the hell is Mirinda?"</p>

<p>It's a girl's name in some quarters, but I never saw it applied to a beverage. So, curious, I picked up the can. It was unopened, and aside from the Mirinda logo, it lacked the usual nutritional value grid, and also the volume was listed as 330 mL only. No Imperial measurements. My god, it's a can from the future!</p>

<p>It was totally my Mr Sparkle moment.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/dnaLRbbc-54" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>But, my momentary flashback to a Simpsons episode faded, and it turns out Mirinda is a product of Pepsi, primarily distributed in Asia. The can actually said "Distributed by Pepsi Singapore" on the side.</p>

<p>I'm guessing it probably fell off of a passing cargo freighter, which most likely took on provisions in the port of Singapore. There's an ever so slight chance it washed up from further away, but most likely it is the boring explanation.</p>

<p>This was totally my Mr Sparkle moment though.</p>

<p>Now, the can is still sealed, so in theory the beverage should be consumable. It's in my fridge right now. I don't drink soda anymore though...</p>

<p>Oh, and I'm totally loving how things look at 1.2 during broad daylight. Very surreal.</p>

<p>While some tell me my strength lies in capturing images, I also have been told I can write well. However, in terms of writing, I do tend to ramble. Hence, this blog's tagline having the words "general ramblings"...</p>

<p>So, when someone asks for me to summarize something, it's nigh-impossible for me to do. So, if you asked me to sum up my own body of photographic work, I'd be at a loss to condense it to a sentence or two. I cringe at committing grammar crimes when I have to post to Twitter. The art of summary is lost to me.</p>

<p>However, someone summarized what I do so well for me just a few minutes ago...</p>

<p>And <em>boom</em>, that sums it up.</p>

<p>I could sit here for hours expounding on noise levels, a-to-d conversions, electric fields emanating from poorly-shielded cabling, the native ISO of a given sensor, and don't-point-your-lens-at-a-10-watt-laser-you-fool type of things and it wouldn't be a summary of how I manage to pull off a shot. It'd be the Book of Pod so to speak. Which, some people like, and some people don't.</p>

<p>It actually speaks volumes about having an outside opinion.</p>

<p>I had just come back from a nighttime run (yes Ryan, I do run around this neighborhood at 1 AM) and I picked up a text conversation where I had left it off earlier. My friend Adriana had just moved from the construction mess called Brickell, to a cozy new joint on Collins Avenue in "Condo Canyon" with her boyfriend. She was inviting me over for a little housewarming thing tomorrow, and she mentioned the last thing she had picked up from her old apt was a piece of mine that she purchased back in 2009:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/frances_2008.jpg" width="640" height="960" title="'Frances at Space - 2008'" ></p>

<p>I had done an exhibit of some of my "dancer photos" at the first <a href="http://lifeisart.org">Life Is Art</a> exhibit in Wynwood. Life is Art, by <a href="http://soulofmiami.org">Soul of Miami</a> founder James Echols, is a local organization that supports up-and-coming artists of all stripes. Since that first open show in 2009, they've come a long way and are quite renowned in the art community, especially amongst artists who may not be "hip" enough to warrant the attention of some of the more corporate art organizations in town. Adriana, at the time, was their treasurer, and had expressed an interest in obtaining a print of one of my images, specifically the one above. So, her mom took it upon herself to pull me aside and purchase it from me for her. As my exhibit was digital (I didn't have the budget to produce 20 prints of size), I took the "order" and contacted my print provider to generate a canvas-framed print for me of this piece. A few weeks later, it was delivered to Adriana, to much acclaim. Oddly enough it's the only "dancer" piece I have ever sold. Either I just haven't marketed them properly or people don't go for half-naked girls in smoky nightclubs as <em>objets d'art</em>.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today. As pieces of art are often delicate, they are usually transported separately from other items in a moving adventure. Anyways, in a conversation about that piece tonight, Adriana was asking me about how I capture moments like that, and I did have a hard time summarizing it up. So, she put it into words that had previously escaped me:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>You have a vision and you wait for the world to fall in line and then you capture it...</p><footer><strong>Adriana D</strong> <cite>A Phone Conversation 12 October 2012</cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>And yes, that's it. Minus the technical details, which, if anyone asks, I'll gladly explain, that's pretty much it. I see the image in my head, and I wait for the world to fall in line. Whether it's in a club or below a deserted bridge in Key West, that's it. If I had to sum it up into a Twitter-friendly sentence, that is it.</p>

<p>Now, if I can summarize this post, it would be, "A different perspective always helps..."</p>

<p>Oh, and Ade, thanks!</p>
