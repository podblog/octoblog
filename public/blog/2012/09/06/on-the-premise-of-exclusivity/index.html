<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="center" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/dvblog/ex.jpg" width="960" height="640" title="'MK II overlooking Space'" ></p>

<p>Over the years, a lot of people have been under the mistaken assumption that I&#8217;ve been the &#8220;exclusive&#8221; photographer for venues and events I&#8217;ve worked with.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t enforce or expect exclusivity, and here&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>At the root of it all, I&#8217;m only one person. I can only be in so many places within a venue at once, especially if it&#8217;s a large scale venue such as Space. I&#8217;ll be upstairs on the Terrace, but the Loft might be uncovered, or the Ballroom. There isn&#8217;t money in the budget to clone me.</p>

<p>Also, the fact that photographers prior to me didn&#8217;t enforce exclusivity with their venue clients was an enormous boost to me being able to do what I do today. If they hadn&#8217;t left that door open, I might not have been as far along as I am today. However, back when I got started, the position/gig of &#8220;club photographer&#8221; was a rare one indeed. More on that in a minute.</p>

<p>And, if I were a large-scale venue manager/owner, and I had it in the budget, I would definitely want multiple photographic perspectives on what was going on that evening. Each and every person who picks up a camera has their own thoughts and ideas on how an image should come out, and it is a definite advertising boon to have those multiple perspectives represented. And in the case of email-harvesting sites posing as photo sites, the venue gets multiple sources of data. I don&#8217;t necessarily approve of the tactic, but it is what it is, and if I were a venue owner or manager, I would avail myself of a few of those sites.</p>

<p>Finally, to be honest, enforcing exclusivity and being &#8220;the guy&#8221; is a real <em>pain</em>. You&#8217;re expected to be everywhere at once, cover the event exactly in the style the client wants, which may not be your style, and the task of club photographer rapidly turns from a fun profession to a &#8220;job&#8221;, i.e. something you have to do to make money. And, frankly, I can think of many healthier activities that aren&#8217;t fun to do at all, that would earn me the same money or more that I do documenting the nightclub scene. I do it primarily because I love to do it, and the financial benefits are just the icing on the cake. You don&#8217;t see people clamoring to spend thousands of dollars on camera equipment just to take it into a smoke-filled room with loud music and sloppy drunk people because it&#8217;s a job.</p>

<p>However, the situation today could be regarded as a little different. Since I got started, the position of club photographer has gone from a rare job description, to one of almost ubiquity. Often, the last thing a party would consider is booking a photographer to document an event. It was usually a &#8220;6 PM on the night of the event&#8221; request, if they thought about it at all. Of course the internet changed that.</p>

<p>Now, if you throw a party at a club, it&#8217;s expected that you will have at least one or two guys on hand to document the event. However, some venues tend to go a little overboard, thinking any exposure is good, and let any guy with an SLR and an excuse into the venue. With the modern set of circumstances in mind, I&#8217;d at least require that the shooter have a full-fledged website (and not just a Facebook page or Flickr gallery) with which their images were to be posted. And, I&#8217;d probably cap the amount of shooters within a venue to a certain amount to avoid &#8220;shooting gallery&#8221; syndrome where there is, in fact, ten or more shooters in a venue. So, exclusivity on one person, not so much, but not overkill like some places are now. Especially if you add in everyone with their iPhones blazing away. But that&#8217;s for another rant.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re in the club shooting world, keep shooting. Don&#8217;t expect or enforce exclusivity though, it&#8217;s not practical and definitely not in the spirit of things. There&#8217;s enough subject matter for all (well, most) of us.</p>
